## Medical Knowledge {#BaM-a-medical-knowledge}

*Cost*: 12CP

The character knows relatively advanced medical treatment techniques.
It can be either a medic, a surgeon or a researcher. Its knowledge is
also correct, regardless of the technological level of the setting. For
example, even if set in a medieval period, the character knows how to
actually cure most illnesses, and the correct prophylactic procedure to
minimise the spread of diseases as the plague.

A character with this perk gains First Aid, and has a modifier of +6 on
all medical skills.
