## Law Enforcer

*Cost*: 15 CP or 20 CP

The character is a member of Police or equivalent Law Enforcement agency. This
includes also roles of Acting Inspectors and Prosecuting Judges.

The character has an initial wealth of 20,000$ and a monthly wage of 1,000$. 
Add 5 CP to be in higher ranks of Law Enforcement (Tenant in a police
station, Prosecutin Judge). In this case, the initial wealth will be
40,000$ and the monthly wage will be 2,000$.

However, the character needs to respect the rules of Law Enforcement
(or face the consequences), and fulfil direct orders from the upper
ranks.

The perk gives a modifier of +2 to Persuade and -1 to Intimidate.
