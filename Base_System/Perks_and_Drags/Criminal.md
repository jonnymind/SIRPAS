## Criminal {#BaM-a-criminal}

*Cost*: 10 CP

The character is an active criminal. It is in hiding and
actively searched by the local law enforcement, and is in
contact with other criminals and criminal organisations.

The character has an initial wealth of 25,000$.

Add 5 CP if the character is also member of an active criminal
organisation. In this case, the character will have an initial
wealth of 50,000$ and a monthly wage of 3,000$, but it must abide
to the rules of the criminal organisation it is part of.

This perk grants a modifier of +2 to Intimidate.

Law Enforcer, Criminal Background, Criminal Boss and Criminal
are mutually exclusive: the character can chose only one of
them.
