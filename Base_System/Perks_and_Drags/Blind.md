## Blind

*Cost*: -40 CP

The character is blind. It can still use this drag even
if it has a substitute for normal vision, provided the
substitute is just minimising the disadvantage. For example,
having a dog companion that guides the character through every
possible obstacle is still blindness, but having the ability to
communicate telepathically with demonic minions and use their
sight would invalidate this perk.
