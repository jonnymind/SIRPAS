A check consists of throwing dices and verify if the result is successful.
Checks are the nuts and bolts of Sirpas. Practically every action that 
might succeed or fail requires performing a successful check. There different 
kind of checks that apply to different situations, but in general, a check 
consists in beating some high point score summing a 3d6 with the value of
