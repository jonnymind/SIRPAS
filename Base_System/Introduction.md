# Introduction

Sirpas stands for “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”. Everything here is
streamlined and stripped to what you need to get your role playing adventures
going, including the count of words in the descriptions. 

So, we’re talking
“adventures” here: a role playing session that can spawn for a casual night with
friends, or with the family, or with strangers met at a gaming club. Systems
thought for Role Playing Games are (usually) complex enough for you to invest
lots of time in creating your characters, play through multiple sessions and use
some time off to sort your past games out to get fun out of them. 

Some may say
that’s actually part of the fun itself. If you like the streamlined experience
of Sirpas gameplay, you can play adventures spawning multiple sessions, or
multiple adventures with the same characters, in the same world (this is often
referred as campaign). 

But you don’t need to. The idea is having as little
commitment necessary to get playing, and then, pour in as much commitment as you
want if you like it.
