# Attributes

Attributes are a finer description than the mains for a character, and form the
base for all the underlying skills. In the base system, there are four physical
and four mental attributes, which are respectively based on body and mind. By
default the attributes assume the same value of their base, but itâ€™s possible to
increase attribute values with character points.

When creating a character, it is possible to reduce the value of attributes
(buying negative points) in order to gain CP to be invested in othertattributes, 
skills, or eventually, even on mains. As this operation mighttchange the base 
of attributes, to avoid ambiguities, first all the increase musttbe bought, 
possibly resulting in a negative balance of CP, then the attributes
(andteventually skills) are sold. At the end of the process, the CP balance must 
be in the positive. For example, suppose we have 30 CP, and we want to upgradetbodytfrom 12 to 13. 
This costs 42 CP, bringing our balance to 30-42 = -12. Now, physical attributes have base 13, 
so we can sell a point of Health, goingtdowntfrom 13 to 12, and gaining 14 points, 
which brings the balance of CP backtto 2.
