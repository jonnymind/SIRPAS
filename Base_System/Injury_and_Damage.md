# Injury and Damage

Damage received in combat, or in other situations, impacts on the current
physical or mental health of the character. 

However, the actual effect of damage can vary depending on the character
receiving it. The effect of a certain damage source on humans might be different
from the effect on machines, artificial intelligence, ghosts, wild beasts and
mythological monsters, to name few.
