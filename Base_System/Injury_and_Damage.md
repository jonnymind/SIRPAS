# Injury and Damage {#BaM-gen-injury-and-damage}

Damage received in combat, or in other situations, impacts on the current
physical or mental health of the character.

## Injury statistics {#BaM-gen-injury-statistics}

Generic damage is measured in _Damage Points_ (**DP**), which can cause
_wounds_ if exceeding a threshold. Some damage sources can also cause directly
a _wound_.

The severity of a _wound_ determine the amount of _injury points_ it inflicts
to the character.

_Damage points_, _wounds_ and _injury points_ (**IP**) have different effects on
different characters, depending on the most appropriate way to keep track of
damage in a particular context. For example, living creatures will die if they
sustain too many _wounds_, while a body-less AI could not be wound, but be
able to sustain a certain amount of **DP** before being disabled.

## Wounds and Injury points {#BaM-gen-injury-points}

The severity of wounds determine the amount of injury points it inflicts on
the characters receiving them, according with the following table:
