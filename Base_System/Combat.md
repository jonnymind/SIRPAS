# Combat

Combat can play an important role in some adventures. However, even in those
adventures that don’t have a strong emphasis on combat, Sirpas provides a layer
of rules that can be applied to situations where characters need to fight, which
cannot be covered by a simple contest roll. For example, Sirpas combat rules
would cover a situation where two hackers, or artificial intelligences, are
trying to acquire the control of a network server, or are trying to attack each
other system. Similarly, a context of magical means might be solved through the
combat rules: for example, a sorcerer trying to cast a curse on a village and a
priest trying to prevent it.

Using the combat rules, instead of a simple and direct contest, is a choice that
rests upon the Master and the players, and the choice should be made depending
on how everyone feels about that particular situation — or about the tenor of
the adventure.
