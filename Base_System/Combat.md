# Combat

Combat is an advanced form of contest. In a normal contest, characters
try to win one over another on specific skills. Also in combat, there
the contest is finalized at harming an opponent or defending from an attack.

Sirpas provides several sub-systems to resolve conflicts, increasingly
detailed (and complex):

* *Basic Combat*: It's the simplest way to resolve combats, with minimal
	additions with respect to a normal contest roll. It also deals with fights
	among small groups of characters. It's simply considered a specialized
	skill contest for combat.
* *Simplified Combat*: A simplified version of the full combat system, with
	fewer rules to take care of, but still more precise than the *Basic Combat*.
* *Advanced Combat*: This is the full fledged combat system, based on
	special usage of combat sub-skills called _manoeuvres_.

You can mix and match these sub-systems in the same adventure, without
limitation. You can either choose one or another depending on the experience
of the players, or their inclinations, or you can base the choice on the
relevance of the combat in the adventure. For example, you could resolve
a brawl erupted in a tavern as a *basic combat*, to turn to the
*advanced combat* when things get nasty while fighting the guards to escape
a dungeon.
