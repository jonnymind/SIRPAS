# Advantages

Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific skill in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.
While most advantages are simply possessed by a character or not, some can have different levels. For example, Survival Instinct can have a level 1 and 3, each level granting a higher modifier. In that case, the description of the advantage indicates the initial cost and the cost per additional level. The cost of a further level is given by the base cost, plus the additional level cost times the current level. For example, if the description indicates the cost of being 5/2, it means that the first level costs 5, the second 5+2*1 = 7, the third 5+2*2 = 9 and so on.
Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, or having a certain minimal score in some specific statistic.
