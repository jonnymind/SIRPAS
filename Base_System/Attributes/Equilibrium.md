## Equilibrium {#BaM-c-equilibrium}

Equilibrium (*E*) is the stability of the mind, 
or basically the equivalent of its health (*H*).
 
It indicates how much mental strain a person can take before being debilitated; 
of course, it is also important in those settings where attacks are delivered 
to the mind instead of the body: fantasy, sci-fi and horror settings 
can present as many dangers for the mind as for the body, or more.
