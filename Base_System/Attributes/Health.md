## Health {#BaM-c-health}

Health (*H*) represents the resistance to illness and polluted 
environment (including allergenic agents). The level of health
influences also the amount of damage that a body can sustain before
being wounded, and thatâ€™s very important in fights and other 
dangerous situations.
