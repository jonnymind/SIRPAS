## Perception (W; H) {#BaM-s-perception}

Determines whether the character is able to detect an element in the surrounding
that is hard to spot, as a secret door, a potential danger, a follower and so
on.

It is used when there arenâ€™t more specific skills to be applied in the specific
situation. For example, trying to find traps is done by rolling on traps.
