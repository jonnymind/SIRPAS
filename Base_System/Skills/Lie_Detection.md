## Lie Detection (mI; H)

This skill represents the ability of the character to detect lies, given
small hints on the voice, facial expressions and behaviour of the target.

A skilled lier can oppose its deception. Otherwise, the character can try
a check on this skill, with a difficulty that depends on the amount of
information the character has about the truth.
