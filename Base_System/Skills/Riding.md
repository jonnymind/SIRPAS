## Riding/mount (mD) {#BaM-s-riding}

This skill is used to perform particularly difficult actions while riding a
specific animal. For example, jumping a fence with a horse, jumping across
acrobatic platforms with a motor bike, running through a busy skyline with a
flying car and so on.

The skill is specific for each device (or animal) that the character might ride.
Some riding specialisation can be baseless, if learning them requires a specific
preparation (for example, helicopter pilot).
