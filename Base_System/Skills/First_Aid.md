## First Aid (-) {#BaM-s-first-aid}

The character can stabilize a disabled target with a successful check. If a
first aid kit is available, the check becomes trivial.

The character can also cure a fresh wound with a successful check; having a
first-aid kit at disposal gives a modifier of +6 (some special first aid kits
have higher modifiers). 

The user can also cure more fresh wounds on the same character, applying a -2
penalty to for each further wounds cured.
