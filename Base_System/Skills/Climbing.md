## Climbing (D; E)

Used to check when the character climbs a section of wall 6 feet high. Use the
following table to determine the difficulty of the action:

$(include /Base_System/tables/climbing.md)

If the character fails, it stays at its current spot, and it can try again
with the repeated attempt modifiers.

A critical failure implies that the character fell from the current spot.
A critical success indicates it climbed for 12 feet instead of 6.
