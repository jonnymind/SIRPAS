Specific healing aids in the target setting can provide other modifiers.
The time required for the healing to be performed depends on the setting
and on the device used. A SF cellular replicator or a magic balm could
allow healing incapacitating wounds in one day, in a few hours or in minutes,
while in other settings, an herbal healing remedy might require a week.
