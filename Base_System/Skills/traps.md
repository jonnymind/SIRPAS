## Traps (I; H)

This skill represents the knowledge of the character about traps, and is used
to either detect, build or try and disarm traps, with the following modifiers:

$(include Base_System/tables/traps.md)

Each tarp might come with a separate specific modifier in order to be
detected and disarmed. Once a trap is discovered, the character might
attempt a separate check on Traps at normal difficulty to determine
its modifier prior attempting to remove it.
