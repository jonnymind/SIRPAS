## Mastery/skill (10CP)

__*Preprequisite*__: *Expertise/skill*

Skill Mastery (SM/skill) is an advantage that is 
applied on a specific skill. As a pre-requisite,
the character must have already Expertise on the same skill.

Mastery changes all the checks using that skill from a 3d6 
throw to a 2d6+6 (as if one dice is always automatically 
rolling a 6).
