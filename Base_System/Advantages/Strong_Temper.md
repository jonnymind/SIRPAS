## Strong Temper (20CP)

__*Preprequisite*__: *Hard To Die*

The character can withstand an additional wound from
physical sources before being incapacitated, and will
not die in case the last wound received was from a
physical source if not treated for 1 hour, regardless
of the Injury Points sustained. 

The last physical wound received during a fight will
automatically heal in 6 hours, even if not treated.
