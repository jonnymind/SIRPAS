# Perks and Drags

Perks and drags are generic advantages and disadvantages that don’t 
impact the game system directly. They usually give more flavour  in 
terms of roleplaying, and better define a character in its settings.
 Being famous, of noble origins, being able to play a certain instrument, 
 knowing a certain literature or scientific topic, being rich, and the 
 inverse of those are considered perks. 
 
They can and usually will have an influence in how the adventure play, 
and some of them has also some indirect effect on the rules. For example, 
Medical Knowledge is mainly meant for your character to be able to speak 
competently about illnesses and cures, but it also influences the rolls on 
First Aid; Criminal Boss is meant to direct your adventure in a certain 
direction, but it also influences the skill Intimidate.
