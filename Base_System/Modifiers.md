# Modifiers

In some situation, instead of using a statistic as a direct base, 
the system requires to use a base modifier.

This happens when some  statistics are baseless by their own nature, 
but a base statistic influences them nevertheless.

For example, many combat styles are baseless, as you need to learn them from scratch to be good at those, 
but characters with a higher dexterity, or rather strength, are naturally better at it.
