## Repeated contest {#BaM-m-repeated-context}

In some contest rolls, draws are considered stalemate. In this cases, the
characters might decide to give up (and leave the situation at a standstill as
it is), or try a completely new roll.

For example, consider two characters trying to pull an object away from the grip
of the other (i.e. a precious gold statuette found in an ancient temple). They
roll a contest on strength, and a draw means that neither was able to snitch the
treasure away from the other. Now, if there isnâ€™t any savage tribe running after
them, or if the temple is not collapsing, they may try again the same roll.
