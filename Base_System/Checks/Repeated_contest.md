## Repeated contest

In some contest rolls, draws are considered stalemate. In this cases, the
characters might decide to give up (and leave the situation at a standstill as
it is), or try a completely new roll.

For example, consider two characters trying to pull an object away from the grip
of the other (i.e. a precious gold statuette found in an ancient temple). They
roll a contest on strength, and a draw means that neither was able to snitch the
treasure away from the other. Now, if there isn’t any savage tribe running after
them, or if the temple is not collapsing, they may try again the same roll.
