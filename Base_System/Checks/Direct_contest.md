## Direct contest

Some actions are performed either in competition or against other characters.
When this happens, a contest check must be performed. Both characters (or the
Master in place of NPCs), must roll a 3d6 and add the value of the skill on
which the contest is performed; the character scoring the highest points wins
the contest.

Some contest can be asymmetrical: for example, an attacker will roll on some
attack skill, while a defender will try and prevent the attacker success using
some defence skill. The skill and combat sections describe some possible
asymmetric skills, but players and masters (and other expansions) might come up
with new ones if the situation suggests so.

Draws can be allowed or rerolled, depending on the situation and the skill. For
example, suppose that two characters struggle to reach for a weapon during a
brawl, with a contest on dexterity. If they roll a draw, it means both of them
reached for the weapon, and now the situation has changed.

In other cases, the draw might be ignored and rerolled until some of the
participants win on the others. In this case, the draw is ignored, as if not
rolled. This is the case of all the ranking rolls.

In other cases yet, the draw means a temporary stalemate in the situation. This
then becomes a repeated contest.
