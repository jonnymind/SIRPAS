## Critical Results

In some situations, it is possible to achieve a spectacular success, or a
devastating failure.  The vast majority of direct checks and some contests are
subject to this effect, unless specified otherwise.

The actual result of a critical success or failure will be determined by the GM,
if not specified in the skill description itself.

This table represents what happens when rolling a high value, depending on the
success margin.

$(include /Base_System/tables/critical_success.md)

A roll of 18 always results in a success, even if the value of the base skill 
plus the rolled 18 wouldn’t be enough to pass the level (SM less than or equal
to zero).

When SM is 1, a roll of 18 is a critical success. When it’s SM is larger than 
one, a 17 is enough, when it’s 3 or larger, 16 is enough, and when it’s 6 or 
larger, a 15 is enough.

Similarly, the following is the table of the critical failure:

$(include /Base_System/tables/critical_failure.md)

This applies also to contests. Suppose a very strong character is facing a weak 
opponent, and that the stronger character might win even by adding 3 points to 
its base attack skill value. If it actually rolls a 3, the skill will fail, even 
with a positive success margin.
