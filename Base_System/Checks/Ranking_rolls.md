## Ranking rolls {#BaM-m-ranking-rolls}


Ranking rolls are contests between two or more characters, ranking them in a
order that doesnâ€™t allow for draws. Also, the margin each character has on the
other is not relevant. For example, to establish the arrival order in a running
relay, every participant rolls a ranking on running. 

The order of arrival is
decided once and for all, for the whole ranking, and draws are not allowed.

Draws are resolved by re-rolling on the same skill. The re-roll is only relevant
for the relative order of the characters in draw. For example, suppose that, in
said race, four character score a total of 26, 22, 22 and 20 respectively. Now,
the second and third characters roll to decide their relative position. Now, if
player A rolls 26 and player B rolls 18, the A ends up second, and the B ends up
third, no matter what the other participant scored before.
