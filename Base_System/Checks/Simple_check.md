## Simple check

A simple check is a direct check on a precise skill (or in rarer cases, on an
attribute or on a main). For example to verify if the character can land safely
after jumping down from a height, a check on the skill acrobatics must be
performed.

To win a simple check, the sum of 3d6 and the value of the skill must be equal
or above 21. Modifiers can be applied when the check is particularly easy or
hard:

$(include /Base_System/tables/difficulty.md)

Instead of the generic difficulty level, some skills have specific modifiers;
for example, jumping from a height requires a check on acrobatics with a
modifier that depends on how high is the jump.
