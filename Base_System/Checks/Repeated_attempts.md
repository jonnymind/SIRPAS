## Repeated attempts {#BaM-m-repeated-attempts}

In some situation, it is possible to repeat a failed attempt soon after the
first try. For example, picking a lock (when no one is around and there aren’t
time constraint) can be repeated indefinitely, until a success is achieved — or
unless the lock is actually impossible to pick.

Normally, any skill that can rationally be performed more than once in a row can
be repeated by applying a penalty of two points. For example, suppose you’retrying 
to break in an apartment; you have to perform a check against *lock picking* at normal
level, and your lock picking skill is at level 13. You roll 3d6 for 6 points, 
for a total of 19, which is a failure. If you have enough time to try again, you can, 
but now you must win against 23. You roll a 9, for a total of 22 (bad luck there), 
and if you want to try again, now you must beat 25. You our 3d6 scores a 13, and 13+13 
gives a total of 26, which is a success.

The time required for an attempt is usually indicated in the description of the target
skill; if not, is decided by the master, depending on the situation.
