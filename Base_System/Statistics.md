# Statistics

In Sirpas, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that define a characters. 
They are divided in the following categories:
* Mains: basic statistics on which every aspect of the character depends. 
  In the base system, they are body (*B*) and mind (*M*).
* Attributes: important aspect of the character on which many other mechanics depend. 
  For example: *health* and *will*.
* Skills: specific abilities to perform some actions, 
  as *hacking*, *lock picking*, *running*, *climbing* etc.
* Injury Statistics: A set of statistics that regulate how characters receive and resist damage;
  for example Damage Points (*DP*) and Injury Points (*IP*).
* Advantages/disadvantages: Statistics affecting others, as example an expert 
  modifier which increase the chance of winning checks against a specific skill. 
* Perks/drags: distinctive traits setting the character apart from the 
  background people in the game world. Could be things a “famous” or “criminal”. 
  They have an impact in the adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly 
  some checks, providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.

Numeric statistics are normally expressed as a value between 3 and 18, 
which is the range of value that can be expressed by summing the 
result of a 3d6 dice throw. A value of 3 represents the minimum skill 
level, or characteristic, that a character could have to be still 
considered minimally  functional in the game world — a value below 3 
would indicate a sub-normal characteristic. A value of 18 would represent 
the apex for the game environment, and the values between 10 and 12 would be 
the most common across the reference population.

The scaling would be relative to the game setting. For example, if playing 
a campaign where the characters are Greek or Norse gods, a value of 3 on any 
statistic would probably express a skill level far superior to that of humans.

Notice that the scaling is not linear: it follows the probability distribution
of the 3d6 dice throw. For example, a character with strength 12 is just marginally 
stronger than one with strength 11, but one with strength 18 is in a totally 
different league than one with strength 17. Similarly, characters with health 
10 and 11 have a very similar constitution, but one with health 3 will 
be much more gracile than one with health 4.

Different settings might introduce different ranges with other scaling rules; 
for example in a vampire society, the body could be measured in a 0-100 range, 
with B0 being worth a human B18, and where the difference between B0 and B1 is 
the same as between a B99 and B100.
