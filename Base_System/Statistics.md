# Statistics {#BaM-gen-statistics}

In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that define a characters. 
They are divided in the following categories:

* Attributes: important aspect of the character on which many other mechanics depend. 
  For example body (*B*), mind (*M*), *health* and *will*.
* Structural Staticstics, or **Structs**: A set of statistics that regulate how 
  characters are structurally built; for example, how they receive and resist damage,
  how much stress they can sustain before going deranged, how many times they must feed
  or recharge in a day, and so on.
* Skills: specific abilities to perform some actions, 
  as *hacking*, *lock picking*, *running*, *climbing* etc.
* Advantages/disadvantages: Statistics affecting other skills, as example an expert 
  modifier which increase the chance of winning checks against a specific skill. 
* Perks/drags: distinctive traits setting the character apart from the 
  background people in the setting. Could be things a “famous” or “criminal”. 
  They have an impact in the adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly 
  some checks, providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.

Attributes and skills are normally expressed as a value between 3 and 18, 
which is the range of value that can be expressed by summing the 
result of a 3d6 dice throw. A value of 3 represents the minimum skill 
level, or characteristic, that a character could have to be still 
considered minimally  functional in the game world — a value below 3 
would indicate a sub-normal characteristic. A value of 18 would represent 
the apex for the game environment, and the values between 10 and 12 would be 
the most common across the reference population.

The scaling would be relative to the game setting. For example, if playing 
a campaign where the characters are Greek or Norse gods, a value of 3 on any 
statistic would probably express a level of proficiency far superior to that of
any human.

Notice that the scaling is not linear: it follows the probability distribution
of the 3d6 dice throw. For example, a character with strength 12 is just marginally 
stronger than one with strength 11, but one with strength 18 is in a totally 
different league than one with strength 17. Similarly, characters with health 
10 and 11 have a very similar constitution, but one with health 3 will 
be much more gracile than one with health 4.

Different settings might introduce different ranges with other scaling rules; 
for example in a vampire society, the Body attribute (**B**) could be measured 
in a 0-100 range, where a B0 for a vampire would be equivalent to a B18 for a human,
and where the difference between B0 and B1 and between B49 and B50 is the same.
