## Attacking and Defending

Manoeuvres are divided in three types: attacks, defences and actions.
When a character turns comes, it can use any of the manoeuvre at his disposal.
If it uses an attack, it must declare a target, and the target must now decide
how to defend. Normally, it will want to use a defence, but it could try other
manoeuvres; any non-defence manoeuvre used against an attack which will have a
hard modifier.

Once the attacker and the defender have chosen their actions, a contest between
the involved skills is performed, and the winner will have its action being
successful.

The amount of damage inflicted by as successful attack (or a defence involving a
counter-attack) may depend on the manoeuvre, the level of its style, the weapon
used, and the success margin and other factors specific of each manoeuvre. For
example, a simple punch from melee combat will cause a damage equal to the
strength of the attacker plus the success margin.
 
The defender needs to use one of its available manoeuvres when named as a target
by the attacker. If it has exhausted all its manoeuvres, it can either use an
Instinctive Defence against physical attacks, or a Willpower Defence against
mental attacks, or let the attacker attack freely. In the last case, the attack
becomes a trivial check.
