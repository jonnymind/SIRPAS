## Repeated Manoeuvres

Some manoeuvre get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly against the same
target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has diminishing returns: your
opponent will read your move, and will be able to better defend against the same
attack. In those situations, youâ€™ll want to be less predictable, and use other
manoeuvres, or other styles altogether.
