## Combat Style Cost

Combat styles have a specific cost rule that differs from the other skills.
Instead of following the cost table for simple/normal/hard skills, each level of
a combat style costs the number of the level, plus a specific value that differ
for each style.

For example, if the cost of brawl is 2. Bringing up brawl from 0 to 1 requires 3
CP (1+2), from 6 to 7 it requires 9 CP (2+7), and from 17 to 18 it requires 20
CP.
