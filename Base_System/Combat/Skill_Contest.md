## Combat as a Skill Contest

A first option for resolving combat scenes is that of simply using the combat
skills in a normal skill contest.

This is an option for when a small group of opponents (normally, two to six)
are facing each other with _compatible_ fighting skills and weaponry.
For example, you can use this method when two small bands are shooting at
each other using the __firearm__ skill, or involved in a fist fight and
using __brawl__, or taking part in a little __swordfight__ skirmish.

To perform combat as a simple _skill contest_, all the participant must:
1. Agree to use the same skill. For example, this can't be done if one
	of the fight is addressed as a __brawl__, but one of the characters
	wants to use __archery__.
2. All the participants can actually use the skill involved. It's common
	knowledge that you don't bring a knife in a gunfight.

However, a character can use __Generic Manoeuvres__ skill to participate
a fight this way, if they agree. For example, if everyone else is using
__swordfight__, one character that happens to have a sword in their hands,
but not knowing __swordfight__, could use __Generic Manoeuvres/slash__
instead, which acts as a sort of base for everyone trying to swing a
weapon.

In the most extreme case, a player might wish to go along
trusting its companions, and using __instinctive defence__ in the fight.

### Contest Resolution

The contest is performed by having everyone involved rolling on the selected
skill. Order the scores from each party in decreasing values. The top score
in one party is matched against the top of the other, the second highest
on one side against the second highest on the other and so on.

The party realising the highest number of victories is the winning side.

The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances and the number of
critical successes/failures on each party. For example, a tavern brawl is
hardly lethal, and a "friendly" swordfight (i.e. in order to subdue or
dissuade an opponent) might simply end with the surrender of the losing
party.

If you _want_ to determine the result of winning or losing the fight
with more precision, you _can_ use the following rules.

### Injury Generation

If the fight is serious, the losing party will receive:
* Two light wounds for each defeat.
* Two serious wounds for each critical failure.
* Two heavy wounds for each critical success in the winning party.

The winning party takes two serious injuries for each critical failure.

### Damage Ranking

The injuries are randomly distributed by a ranking on either __body__ or __mind__,
depending on the type of fight in which the party was involved.

* The last ranked will enough wounds to knock it out, starting from the heaviest
ones;
* if not enough wounds were produced as __Injury Generation__ to knock out
	the last ranked character, it will receive enough __light wounds__ to fill the
 	difference.
* if some wounds are still not distributed, they will be assigned to the second-last
	ranked, up to knocking it out.
* injuries are distributed upwards until exhaustion.

A __critical success__ in the damage ranking averts the __worst__ injury received,
regardless of the position in the ranking -- even if there is just one combatant.

For example, in a one-to-one fight, the defeated character can avert the worst
injury among the ones knocking it out with a critical success on the
__damage ranking__.

### Fight Continuation

If the defeated party so desires, they can continue fighting, repeating the skill
contest and the damage ranking, until there is someone standing.

### Fight length

In terms of fight length, each contest is lasts a number of round equal to the number
of participants.

### Weapons and Armours

All weapons and armours have a __dominance__ score, which indicates how well they fare
in the __combat contest__, and __basic combat__.

The weapon __dominance__ is added to the __combat contest__ roll, while the armour
__dominance__ is added to the __damage ranking__.
