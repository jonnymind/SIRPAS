## Advanced Combat

Advanced Combat is organised in styles and manoeuvres. A style is a skill that follow
some special rule (for example, it has different cost per level with respect to
easy, normal and hard skills). It describes the proficiency with a certain fight
style, or with weapons that need a particular training to be effectively used.
Being able to use a style gives access to some of its manoeuvres (with more
manoeuvres unlocked as the proficiency with the style increases), which have
certain effects on the combat.

### Attacking and Defending

Manoeuvres are divided in three types: attacks, defences and actions.
When a character turns comes, it can use any of the manoeuvre at his disposal.
If it uses an attack, it must declare a target, and the target must now decide
how to defend. Normally, it will want to use a defence, but it could try other
manoeuvres; any non-defence manoeuvre used against an attack which will have a
hard modifier.

Once the attacker and the defender have chosen their actions, a contest between
the involved skills is performed, and the winner will have its action being
successful.

The amount of damage inflicted by as successful attack (or a defence involving a
counter-attack) may depend on the manoeuvre, the level of its style, the weapon
used, and the success margin and other factors specific of each manoeuvre. For
example, a simple punch from melee combat will cause a damage equal to the
strength of the attacker plus the success margin.

The defender needs to use one of its available manoeuvres when named as a target
by the attacker. If it has exhausted all its manoeuvres, it can either use an
Instinctive Defence against physical attacks, or a Willpower Defence against
mental attacks, or let the attacker attack freely. In the last case, the attack
becomes a trivial check.

### Repeated Manoeuvres

Some manoeuvre get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly against the same
target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has diminishing returns: your
opponent will read your move, and will be able to better defend against the same
attack. In those situations, you’ll want to be less predictable, and use other
manoeuvres, or other styles altogether.

### Manoeuvre description

Other than the style they refer to, manoeuvres are defined by:

* *Type*: Attack, defence or action.
* *Prerequisite*: Set of requirements that need to be met in order to use
  this manoeuvre.
* *Modifier*: The manoeuvre might have a modifier to be applied to the style
  skill. The modifier might be fixed, or be based on an attribute. See the
  Base Modifier table.
* *Range*: melee or a maximum distance — might depend on the weapon used, if any.
  Metaphysics manoeuvres have no range.
* *Diminishing Return (DR)*: modifier applied to each repeated usage on the same
  target.
* *Damage type*: subtype of damage caused by the manoeuvre.
* *Damage*: Amount of damage caused by a successful contest. Here, SM stands
  for Success Margin.
* *Condition*: Special conditions applied by a success. If in parenthesis, the
  condition is applied only in special cases, otherwise it’s always applied on
  success.
* *Limited*: manouvres that can be used only with a subset of the weapons
  used by this style.

Conditions can be one of the following:

* *Wound*: A success causes an immediate wound — the seriousness of the wound
  being described here or in the skill description.
* *Block*: the target is grappled or anyhow blocked. The description of the
  skill will specified wether the attacker is blocked too.
* *Stun X*: the target is stun for a count X of turns, giving it a modifier
  of -2 to any action.
* *Fall*: The target falls on the ground, and is “grounded” for the next turn.
* *Disarm*: The target loses its weapon.
* *Cripple*: A limb of the target is crippled and becomes impaired. All
  actions requiring that limb receives a -4 modifier. If the crippled
  limb is a leg, 4-legged animals reduce their movement to half, bipedal
  animals (including human) to 1/4.

Notice that defences might have a damage type and a damage as well: some defence
acts as a counter-attack, inflicting damage on success.

When a defence has a range, it means that it can be used only if the attacker is
at least as far as the range indicates.
