## Advanced Combat

Advanced Combat is the most sophisticated combat sub-system; it expands the
simplified combat system by adding the concept of manoeuvres.

Manoeuvres are sub-skills for combat styles; the represent a special action a
Character can take while using the combat skill.

There are specific manoeuvres to attack and defend in each style, and each of
them has different balances of difficulty of execution versus potential damage,
or different effects on the reset of the combat. Some manoeuvres provide
modifiers to subsequent moves, while some other generate damage also
when defending.

### Diminishing Returns

Some manoeuvres get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly against the same
target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has diminishing returns: your
opponent will read your move, and will be able to better defend against the same
attack. In those situations, you’ll want to be less predictable, and use other
manoeuvres, or other styles altogether.

This factor is called __diminishing return__ (DR) for a certain manoeuvre.

### Manoeuvre description

Other than the style they refer to, manoeuvres are defined by:

* *Type*: Attack, defence or action.
* *Prerequisite*: Set of requirements that need to be met in order to use
  this manoeuvre.
* *Modifier*: The manoeuvre might have a modifier to be applied to the style
  skill. The modifier might be fixed, or be based on an attribute. See the
  Base Modifier table.
* *Range*: melee or a maximum distance — might depend on the weapon used, if any.
  Metaphysics manoeuvres have no range.
* *Diminishing Return (DR)*: modifier applied to each repeated usage on the same
  target.
* *Damage type*: subtype of damage caused by the manoeuvre.
* *Damage*: Amount of damage caused by a successful contest. Here, SM stands
  for Success Margin.
* *Limited*: manouvres that can be used only with a subset of the weapons
 used by this style.
* *Condition*: Special conditions applied by a success. If in parenthesis, the
  condition is applied only in special cases, otherwise it’s always applied on
  success.

Notice that defences might have a damage type and a damage as well: some defence
acts as a counter-attack, inflicting damage on success.

When a defence has a range, it means that it can be used only if the attacker is
at least as far as the range indicates.
