## Basic Combat

__Basic Combat__ is the most simple form of complete combat rules, dealing
specifically with different characters on the fighting ground, performing
different actions.

### Attack and Defence

When an attack is declared, the target (or targets) can use a defence, either
by using a specific combat skill or a _generic defence_.

The attacker and defender perform a Contest using their chosen skill as a base.
The attacker will add the modifier from the _dominance_ of its combat skill,
and if any, of its weapon; similarly, the defender will add the _dominance_
of the selected skill, and eventually, of its armour, to the defence roll.

> Note: you can ignore the skill _dominance_ if attacker and defender use
the same skill (or if the _dominance_ is the same).

### Damage

If the attacker succeeds, it wounds the target. The seriousness of the wound
depends on the success margin.

### Resist Damage

The defender can degrade one injury per turn to the lower level (or avoiding
completely light wounds) by performing a check on [__health__](#Health), for
phisical attacks, or [__equilibrium__](#Equilibrium) for mental attacks,
with the following modifiers:
