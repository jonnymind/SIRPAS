## Basic Combat

A first option for resolving combat scenes is that of simply using the combat
skills in a normal skill contest.

This is an option for when a small group of opponents (normally, two to six)
are facing each other with _compatible_ fighting skills and weaponry.
For example, you can use this method when two small bands are shooting at
each other using the __firearm__ skill, or involved in a fist fight and
using __brawl__, or taking part in a little __swordfight__ skirmish.

To perform combat as a _basic combat_, all the participant must:
1. Agree to use the skills based on the same _root skill_.
   For example, a _basic combat_ can take place when all the characters
   use __brawl__ or __full contact__, which is based on __brawl__, but not
   if one of the characters is going to use __archery__ or __firearms__.
2. Be actually able to use the skills involved. It's common
	knowledge that you don't bring a knife in a gunfight.

However, a character can use __Generic Manoeuvres__ skill to participate
a fight this way, if they agree. For example, if everyone else is using
__swordfight__, one character that happens to have a sword in its hands,
but not knowing __swordfight__, could use __Generic Manoeuvres/slash__
instead, which acts as a sort of base for everyone trying to swing a
weapon.

In the most extreme cases, a player might wish to go along
with its companions, just using using an __instinctive defence__.

### Fight Resolution

The fight is performed in the following order:
1. have everyone involved to roll on the selected skill.
1. To each roll, add the __dominance__ of the skill chosen by every character,
and if present, also the __dominance__ of their weapon.
1. Order the scores from each party in decreasing values.
1. The top score in one party is matched against the top of the other;
   the second highest on one side is matched against the second highest on the other; and so on.
1. Considering the lowest score in each pair, add the __dominance__ of the
armour of the losing character, if present.
1. If the lower score is still lower after adding the armour __dominance__,
the roll counts as a _victory_ for the other character; otherwise, it is
discarded.
1. The party realising the highest number of victories is the winning side.

In case the number of victories is the same on each side, repeat the
procedure.

The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances and the number of
critical successes/failures on each party. For example, a tavern brawl is
hardly lethal, and a "friendly" swordfight (i.e. in order to subdue or
dissuade an opponent) might simply end with the surrender of the losing
party.

If you _want_ to determine the result of winning or losing the fight
with more precision, you _can_ use the following rules.

## Injury Generation in basic combat (optional)

If the fight is serious, the losing party will receive:
* Two light wounds for each defeat.
* Two serious wounds for each critical failure.
* Two heavy wounds for each critical success in the winning party.

The winning party takes two serious injuries for each critical failure.

> Critical rolls are counted _after_ assigning the skill and weapon
_dominance_ on the initial roll, but before adding the _dominance_ as the
final correction.

### Damage Ranking

The injuries are randomly distributed by a ranking (without draws) on
either __body__ or __mind__, depending on the type of fight in which the
party was involved.

1. List the wounds the receiving party will take, in increasing order of
severity (light to heavy).
1. Assign as many wounds as necessary to match the __disable level__ to the
last ranked, starting from top (the lightest wounds first).
1. Continue with the second-last ranked, until all the wounds are assigned.

The last ranked will be automatically knocked out, receiving enough light
wounds to fill its _disable level_.

Example: a party of four characters receive 6 light, 1 serious and 2
heavy wounds _physical wounds_; all the characters have DL/W=4.
1. the characters perform a draw-free ranking on __body__.
1. The last classified receives 4 light wounds and is knocked out.
1. the second-last receives 2 light, 1 serious and 1 heavy wound, and is
   knocked out;
1. the third-last receives the remaining heavy wound and is still in the fight.

> Notice that the negative modifier for __injury points__ applies to _any_
action, including the fight resolution rolls.

### Fight Continuation

If the characters so desire, they can continue fighting, repeating the
_fight resolution_ and the _damage ranking_, until there is someone standing.

### Fight length

In terms of fight length, each contest is lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of participants.
