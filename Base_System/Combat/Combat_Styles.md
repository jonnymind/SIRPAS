## Combat Styles

Combat styles are skills, which grant access to a series of manoeuvres.
Advantages and perks can be targeted at whole styles; rules that apply to skills
can’t address single manoeuvres, even if their mechanics is similar to that of a
skill.

For example, the advantage expert can be targeted at all the brawl combat style
at once, which includes punch, grab and evade.

The same combat style can also cover different kind of weapons, with some
specific actions limited to some weapons. For example, Firearms is a combat
style including rapid reload and sniping; however, rapid reload can be applied
to pistols only, while sniping requires a precision rifle.

### Combat Style Cost

Combat styles have a specific cost rule that differs from the other skills.
Instead of following the cost table for simple/normal/hard skills, each level of
a combat style costs the number of the level, plus a specific value that differ
for each style.

For example, if the cost of brawl is 2. Bringing up brawl from 0 to 1 requires 3
CP (1+2), from 6 to 7 it requires 9 CP (2+7), and from 17 to 18 it requires 20
CP.
