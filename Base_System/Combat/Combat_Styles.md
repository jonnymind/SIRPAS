## Combat Skills and Styles

The skills used in combat go under the name of _combat styles_. Each style
offers a collection of sub-skills called _manoeuvres_, which are used in the
_advanced combat system_, and specify how a certain style is used during
combat -- with the exception of [generic maneuveres](#Generic Combat Skills),
which are proper skills on their own.

Advantages and perks can be targeted at skills only: either _combat styles_ or
_generic manoeuvres_

For example, the advantage [__expert/skill__](#Exoert) can be targeted at all
the [__brawl__](#Brawl) combat style or at the [__disengage__](#Disengage)
generic manoeuvre, but not at the __punch__ manoeuvre of the __brawl__ style.

The same combat style can also cover different kind of weapons, with some
specific actions limited to some weapons. For example, Firearms is a combat
style including rapid reload and sniping; however, rapid reload can be applied
to pistols only, while sniping requires a precision rifle.

### Combat Skills Cost

Combat skills have a specific progression rule that differs from the other
skills.
Instead of following the cost table for simple/normal/hard skills, each level of
a combat style costs the number of the level, plus a specific value that differ
for each style.

For example, if the cost of __brawl__ is 2. Bringing up brawl from 0 to 1
requires 3 CP (1+2), from 6 to 7 it requires 9 CP (2+7), and from 17 to 18
it requires 20 CP.
