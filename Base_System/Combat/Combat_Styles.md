## Combat Styles

Combat styles are skills, which grant access to a series of manoeuvres.
Advantages and perks can be targeted at whole styles; rules that apply to skills
canâ€™t address single manoeuvres, even if their mechanics is similar to that of a
skill.

For example, the advantage expert can be targeted at all the brawl combat style
at once, which includes punch, grab and evade.

The same combat style can also cover different kind of weapons, with some
pecific actions limited to some weapons. For example, Firearms is a combat
tyle including rapid reload and sniping; however, rapid reload can be applied
to pistols only, while sniping requires a precision rifle.
