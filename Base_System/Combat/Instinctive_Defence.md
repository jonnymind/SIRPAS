## Instinctive Defence

In some situations, the defender is aware of the incoming attack (i.e. has seen
the attacker and is ready to receive the blow) but can’t use any defence. One
reason might be that it already used all the defence at its disposal in a combat
turn and can’t react anymore, or it might be that it has no proficiency in that
kind of combat — this often happens with metaphysical attacks directed at
targets that don’t have a specific skill to use in response — or in case it’s
explicitly dictated by the rules — for example, defending against any attack
after using disengage.

In those cases, provided the defender is at least aware of the attacks, it must
either instinctive defence (against physical attacks) or willpower defence
(against mind attacks).
