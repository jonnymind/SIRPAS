## Manouver description

Other than the style they refer to, manoeuvres are defined by:

* *Type*: Attack, defence or action.
* *Prerequisite*: Set of requirements that need to be met in order to use
  this manoeuvre.
* *Modifier*: The manoeuvre might have a modifier to be applied to the style
  skill. The modifier might be fixed, or be based on an attribute. See the
  Base Modifier table.
* *Range*: melee or a maximum distance — might depend on the weapon used, if any.
  Metaphysics manoeuvres have no range.
* *Diminishing Return (DR)*: modifier applied to each repeated usage on the same
  target.
* *Damage type*: subtype of damage caused by the manoeuvre.
* *Damage*: Amount of damage caused by a successful contest. Here, SM stands
  for Success Margin.
* *Condition*: Special conditions applied by a success. If in parenthesis, the
  condition is applied only in special cases, otherwise it’s always applied on
  success.
* *Limited*: manouvres that can be used only with a subset of the weapons
  used by this style.

Conditions can be one of the following:

* *Wound*: A success causes an immediate wound — the seriousness of the wound
  being described here or in the skill description.
* *Block*: the target is grappled or anyhow blocked. The description of the
  skill will specified wether the attacker is blocked too.
* *Stun X*: the target is stun for a count X of turns, giving it a modifier 
  of -2 to any action.
* *Fall*: The target falls on the ground, and is “grounded” for the next turn.
* *Disarm*: The target loses its weapon.
* *Cripple*: A limb of the target is crippled and becomes impaired. All 
  actions requiring that limb receives a -4 modifier. If the crippled
  limb is a leg, 4-legged animals reduce their movement to half, bipedal
  animals (including human) to 1/4.

Notice that defences might have a damage type and a damage as well: some defence
acts as a counter-attack, inflicting damage on success.

When a defence has a range, it means that it can be used only if the attacker is
at least as far as the range indicates.
