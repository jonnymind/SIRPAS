## Simplified Combat

_Simplified Combat_ builds on the [_Basic Combat_](#Basic Combat), introducing
the concept of _damage_ in place of _wounds_.

The _damage_ and _damage resist_ rules in the _basic combat_ are substituted
with the actual computation of the damage points dealt by the attacker and
absorbed by the armour and other mitigations the defender may offer.

The effect of the damage is computed as described by the
[_injury and damage_](#Injury and Damage) rules.

### Damage computation

The damage caused by a successful attack is determined by the _success margin_
plus the _dominance_ of the attack multiplied by two, or by three if the
attack was a _critical success_ or the defence was a _critical failure_.

The attack _dominance_ is the sum of the skill _dominance_ and any other
_dominance_ provided by weapons, perks, magic, and auxiliary skills.

This amount is then reduced by the passive defence offered by the defender,
which involves its armour and other means, as described by the _injury_ rules.
