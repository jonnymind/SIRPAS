## Combat Turns

Combat is divided in turns. Normally, characters can perform just one manoeuvre
per turn, but certain skills and advantages grant the ability to perform more
manoeuvres.

The length of the turn depends on the settings: it might be one second in a Wild
West setting where gunslingers are fighting, ten seconds when considering melee
fights in medieval settings, one nanosecond in fights between AIs, one minute in
fights between giant robots or starships and so on. 

For most situations, youâ€™ll want to consider the length of a combat turn being
10 seconds.
