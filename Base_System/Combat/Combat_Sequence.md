## Combat Sequence

The combat sequence proceeds as follows:
1.	Free Actions: Characters can perform a combat related action which is not
   directly managed through a skill. For example, drawing a weapon, throwing an
   object they hold, call or yell for help.
2.	Initiative Ranking: all the characters involved in the combat perform a
   ranking on the Initiative skill.
3.	Resolution: Starting from the highest ranked, the characters perform the
   actions at their disposal. If a character has still multiple actions as its
   disposal when its turn comes, it’s free to use them all at once, or wait to use
   any of them at a later moment.
4.	Conclusion: Actions saved for a later moment must be used now or they willebe 
   lost. Effects explicitly beginning “at the end of the turn”, according 
   withetheir description, take place now.
