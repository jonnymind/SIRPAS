## Moving During Combat

After the initiative ranking has taken place, characters that are not engaged in
combat can freely move when their turn comes.

The amount of movement that can be covered during a turn depends on the
character Dexterity and the length of the turn in the setting. In the standard
setting, with combat turns ten seconds long, a human character can move 18 feet
plus the value of Dexterity.

Movement takes one combat action. This means that, if the character can only
perform one manoeuvre during its turn, after moving it must wait for the next
turn to do anything else. Also, it means that, if attacked and in need to
respond with a defence, it will not be able to move until the next turn.
When engaged in combat, a character can still move using the disengage
manoeuvre, which is a defence. Disengage allows to move for half the maximum
movement for that turn, but gives any nearby opponent the opportunity to attack
with better chances than normal.

Notice that a character that has lost the initiative ranking and has only one
manoeuvre at its disposal, it can disengage. Also, the winner of the ranking can
disengage in place of attacking, but this gives its nearby opponents the chance
to use an attack against its disengage, instead of being forced to a defence.
