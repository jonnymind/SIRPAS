## Style and Maneuvers

Combat is organised in styles and manoeuvres. A style is a skill that follow
some special rule (for example, it has different cost per level with respect to
easy, normal and hard skills). It describes the proficiency with a certain fight
style, or with weapons that need a particular training to be effectively used.
Being able to use a style gives access to some of its manoeuvres (with more
manoeuvres unlocked as the proficiency with the style increases), which have
certain effects on the combat.
