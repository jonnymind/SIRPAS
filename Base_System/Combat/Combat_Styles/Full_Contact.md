## Full Contact

$(dd ac_full_contact)
{
   "Cost": "2 CP",
   "Prerequisite": "**Brawl** 4",
   "Dominance": 3
}

An advanced version and extension of Brawl. While still not being a full-fledged
martial art, itâ€™s a style of combat that requires dedication, and if
professionally trained, can be quite effective even against more famous martial
arts.

A character using Full Contact can use all the manoeuvres from *Brawl* under
*Full Contact* instead (whichever has the higher level).

All damage from *full contact* is of __blunt__ type, unless differently
specified.

A well trained full-contact fighter is as dangerous as an armed opponent.
A character using Full Contact can use an extra manoeuvre from this style each
turn.

For example, a character with Full Contact 10 has two manoeuvres it can
chose from either Full Contact or Brawl, plus one from Full Contact only.
