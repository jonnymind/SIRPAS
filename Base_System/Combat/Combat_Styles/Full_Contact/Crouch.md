### Crouch

$(dd cm_full_contact_crouch)
{ "Type": "Action",
	"Prereq": "Full Contact 3"
}

The character loads the next attack, receiving a **DP** modifier equal
to the success margin to be used in the very next attack in Brawl
or Full Contact styles.

If the next manoeuvre used is not an attack, or if the attack fails, 
the modifier is lost.
