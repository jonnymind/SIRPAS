### Overload

$(dd cm_archery_overload)
{ "Type": "Action",
	"Prereq": "Archery 9"
}

Loads two arrows or two bolts in the weapon. The next Shoot will have a fixed
modifier of -3, but the character gains an extra attack after the next shot.

This is useful when it’s not currently possible or ideal to attack a target, but
you don’t want to lose the attack.
