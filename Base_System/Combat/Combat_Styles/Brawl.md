### Brawl

__Cost: 2CP.__

Brawl is the style of fight with bare hand and feet, without a specific
preparation. Itâ€™s often used in tavern and bar fights, and can also be
useful in other combat situations.

Every human or humanoid character has access to brawl.

Unless differently specified, all attacks from *brawl* deal __blunt__ 
damage, and all the manouvres are melee.

The number of manoeuvres the character can use per round depends on
the level of brawl:

$(dt ac_brawl)
[["Level", "Manoeuvres"],
["1-5", 1],
["5-10", 2],
["11-15", 3],
["16+", 4]
