## Generic Manoeuvres

$(dd ac_generic_manoeuvres)

   "Cost": "0 CP",
   "Dominance": 0
}

Generic manoeuvres are themselves proper skills, which any character can use
during a combat.

They differ from normal manoeuvres in the fact that they donâ€™t belong to any
style, and as proper skills, they can be learned independently, and targeted by
advantages and perks.

Generic manoeuvre base CP cost is 0, which means that improving them costs
exactly a number of CP equal to the new value. For example, bringing Instinctive
Defence from 6 to 7 costs 7 CP.
