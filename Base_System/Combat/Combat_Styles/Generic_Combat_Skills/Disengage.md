Disengage is a defence allowing to move half the normal movement speed in the current turn. It automatically succeeds if the opponents are not trying to attack the character using it.
On failure, the disengagement fails and the character cannot move.
If the contest succeeds, the character can move even if other subsequent attacks succeed.
