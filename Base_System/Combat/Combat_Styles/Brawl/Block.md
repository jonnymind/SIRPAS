### Block

}

Block an incoming blow with the lower part of the arms (similar to the guard
in a boxe match).

Can't be used against any weapon, unless the arms are given an amrour
capable to complelety block the attack; for example, a character arm might be 
stuck to an iron rod; in this case, the character can use __block__ against i.e. 
a sword or a mace.
