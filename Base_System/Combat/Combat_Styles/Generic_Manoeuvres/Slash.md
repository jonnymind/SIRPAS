(Stun 2)
A generic combat manoeuvre that can be used with any weapon, including improvised ones. Clubs made out of table legs, guns without ammunitions used as maces, and in general anything you swing at an opponent without knowing exactly what youâ€™re doing is covered under this manoeuvre.
The damage type depends on the nature of the weapon. It can be either cut or blunt.
On critical success, it applies stun for 2 turns.
