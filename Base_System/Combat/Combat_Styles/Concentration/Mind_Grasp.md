}

The character tries to acquire the control of the defendant mind. On success,
the defendant is unable to act until. To keep holding the target, the attacker
must continue to use this attack with + 3 modifier against it at each turn. When
this manoeuvre is used against a blocked target, diminishing return is not
applied on either side.

The attacker must keep using this attack once per turn and can’t move or perform
any other action.

If the attacker receives any damage, the concentration is broken.
