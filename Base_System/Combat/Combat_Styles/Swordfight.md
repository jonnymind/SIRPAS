Swordfight is the simplest discipline for handling traditional melee weapons.
Despite the name, it’s not limited to swords, as it can be used also with maces,
flails, shields and so on.

The style doesn’t differentiate between different kind of weapons as far as
special effect and damage is concerned. To take advantage of the specificities
of each weapon, a character can learn the specific style. Two-handed weapons
can be used through this style as well; they prevent the usage of a shield
(and any manoeuvre related requiring it), but gives a modifier of +4 to the
damage delivered.

The number of manoeuvres the character can use per round depends on the level
of Sword Fight:
