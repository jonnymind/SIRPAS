## Archery

$(dd ac_archery)
{
   "Cost": "6 CP",
   "Modifier": "mD",
   "Dominance": 4
}

This is the base style (and skill) needed to use bows, crossbows and similar projectile
weapons.

Unless differently specified, all attacks from *archery* deal __cut__ damage,
and the range depends on the used weapon.

The number of manoeuvres the character can use per round depends on the level of Archery:

$(dt ac_archery_levels)
[["Level", "Manoeuvres"],
["1-9", 1],
["10-16", 2],
["17+", 3]
]
