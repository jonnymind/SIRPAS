## Damage Mitigation

Incoming damage can be mitigated in several ways. Medieval warriors wear armours
that are extremely effective against cut damage; modern army and militia
fighters wear anti-piercing kevlar jackets; an advanced AI might have redundancy
modules to mitigate the effect of maddening; a monk can meditate to absorb
despair, and so on.

The amount of incoming damage removed is called Damage Mitigation (DM).
Armours, advantages and other means of mitigation that act regardless of the
activity of the character provide an automatic DM, called passive mitigation,
often only for a specific type or subtype of damage source.
Some skill can actively be used to mitigate incoming damage; in that case, the
character receiving the damage must perform a successful check on the skill to
activate the mitigation.

The total value of mitigation after counting all the sources is subtracted from
the incoming damage.

Mitigation cannot reduce the incoming damage to less than 1 DP (unless the
character has the Total Mitigation advantage).
