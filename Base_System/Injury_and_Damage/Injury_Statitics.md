## Injury Statitics

The following statistics determine how damage impacts characters, and are
collectively called Injury Statistics:

* Damage Points (DP/source): amount of damage sustained during a short period (a
  set of chained actions, a combat, etc.). Each source has a different damage
  point pool: physical, mental, and other kind of damage that might be introduced
  in other settings must be accounted for separately.
* Resistance Level (RL/source): Itâ€™s the number of DP a character can take from
  a source before suffering a wound. By default, the resistance level for physical
  damage (RL/p) is the value of Health, and for mental damage (RL/m) is the value
  of Equilibrium.
* Wounds (WND): Number of wounds the character is currently bearing.
* Disable Level (DL): Number of wounds the character can sustain before becoming
  disabled. For humans and human-sized animals, the default is 4.
* Injury Points (IP): Amount of total injury caused by the received wounds. This
  value ultimately determines if a wounded character is in immediate danger of
  death.

Notice that Wounds and Injury Points are related, but they are playing different
roles: the Wounds determine whether a character can still function properly,
*Injury Points* determine if a character is seriously wound.

These statistic are used in different ways throughout different settings, or
they are considered differently for different characters. For example, zombies
will ignore wounds, and can be destroyed only by delivering 4 injury points in a
single blow.

The most common way to use this statistics is called Standard Injury Rule, and
other Injury Rules are given here as examples.
