### Mental Damage

Mental damage types are:

* _Despair_: The mental attack or stress provokes a state of mental
  exhaustion, akin with depression, where the victim is less likely
  to be willing to fight for their own life, or simply, to live. 
  Not to be confused with 
* _Maddening_: The attack strips the victim character of its rationality,
  making its thought processes less coherent, and making it to believe 
  things that are not true. It instills sentiments of paranoia, terror, 
  alienation, or alternatively, irrational boldness.
* _Confusion_: This kind of damage confuses the mind of the target, 
  dumbing down its movement, altering its perception, provoking hallucinations
  and generally scrambling perception and memories. The thought processes 
  of the victim is still sound, and it usually recognises the hallucinations
  as not being real and can deal with the numbed sensations, unless itâ€™s also 
  maddened.
