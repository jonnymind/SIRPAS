### Physical Damage {#BaM-m-physical-damage}

Physical damage types are:

* _Blunt_: Impacts, falls, body slams and blunt weapons generate
   _blunt damage_.
* _Cut_: Sharp weapons generate _cut_ damage, regardless of the
  weapon being used to slash or thrust. For example, a slash hit from a
  broadsword, a thrust from a pike and the wound caused by an arrow are all
  generating _cut damage_.
* _Piercing_: high-power weapons, with the potential to pass through the whole
  body of the target, and with high penetrating power against armours and
  covers, generate _piercing damage_. Guns, lasers, and high-yield crossbows
  are example of piercing weapons.

Notice that simple arrows are _normally_ considered generating
_cut damage_, as they would be stopped by the same kind of armour
designed to stop other cut weapons, but some high-yield modern bow might
generate _piercing damage_ instead.
