### Phisical Damage

Physical damage types are:

* _Blunt_: Impacts, falls, body slams and blunt weapons generate blunt damage.
* _Cut_: Sharp weapons generate cut damage, regardless of the fact that a 
  weapon is used to slash or thrust. For example, a slash hit from a broadsword, 
  a thrust from a pike and the wound caused by an arrow are all generating cut 
  damage.
* _Piercing_: high-power weapons, with the potential to pass through the whole 
  body of the target, and with high penetrating power against armours and covers 
  generate piercing damage. Guns, lasers, and high-yield crossbows are example of 
  piercing weapons.
  
Notice that simple arrows are not normally considered generating piercing damage,
as they would be stopped by the same kind of armour designed to stop other cut 
weapons, but some high-yield modern bow might generate piercing damage instead.
