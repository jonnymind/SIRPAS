### Elemental Damage

Damage caused by energy, or in general, by life-threatening conditions the
character might be subject to, is called elemental damage. It is important do
determine which kind of elemental damage is sustained, as some characters can
have resistance to some kind of element, while other might have a specific
weakness.

All elemental damage cause physical damage, unless differently specified. For
example, the fantasy element _pure magic_ generates mental damage.

Elemental damage bypasses specific mental or physical resistances, but not
generic resistances. For example, a flame thrower will generate heat damage,
against which any specific cut, piercing and blunt damage resistance is useless;
however, a generic resistance to physical damage would still apply.

The elemental damage types are:

* _Chemical_: includes acid and any poisonous substance.
* _Cold_: for example, ice and unsustainable cold.
* _Electricity_: for example, lightning or electric shocks.
* _Heat_: for example, fire and unsustainable heat.
* _Light_: Some creatures are damaged by light (radiation in the visible spectrum).
  _Doesnâ€™t include lasers (which generate heat) or other radiation damage.
* _Pure Magic_: metaphysical damage induced by magic, causing non-specific
  _mental_ damage. Does not include magic spells creating a material
  effect (for example, causing something to catch fire) or directly attacking
  the mind (i.e. a hypnosis inducing magic spell).
* _Radiation_: for example, exposition to radioactive material, neutron guns,
  microwaves etc.
* _Void_: complete air pressure deprivation, i.e. the effects of deep space.
