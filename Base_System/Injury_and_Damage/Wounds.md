## Wounds

Wounds are semi-permanent damage to the character physical and mental health.
They come in various degree of seriousness, which affect the character
differently. Each type of wound gives a certain amount of injury points, which
are counted to determine whether a character can survive a certain amount of
injury or not.

* Light (1 injury point): a wound without serious consequences. The
	character can perform any action without penalty, and the wound will heal within
	a week. 
* Serious (2 injury points): a wound that has consequences on the character
  performance, inflicting a -3 modifier on all actions until healed. The wound
  needs treatment to heal, but it can be degraded to a light wound after a month.
* Incapacitating (4 injury points): the wound is serious enough to cripple 
  the character, for example, to make an arm or a leg non-functional, or in 
  case of mental wounds, to make it unable to think coherently. This wounds
  cannot heala by themselves, and need to be treated by specialists. Any 
  action receives a -6 modifier until healed.
* Deadly (special): The character receiving a deadly wound can possibly 
  dientimmediately. A special procedure is provided to avert immediate death and
  degrade the wound to an incapacitating one later on.
  
When the damage received is larger than the Resistance Level (by default, Health for physical
damage and Equilibrium for mental damage), a wound is received. The outstanding 
damage past that level determines the severity. 

* If it’s less than half the reference attribute, the wound is light.
* If it’s half of the reference value but less than the value, it’s serious.
* If it’s large as the resistance level value but less than the double, it’s incapacitating.
* If it’s the double of the value or more, it’s deadly.

The following table resumes the various aspects of wounds:

Modifiers from wounds are cumulative. For example, if a character receives two serious and one incapacitating wounds, it will be subject to a -12 modifier until healed.
The effect of wounds and injury points vary depending on the nature of the character and on the setting. Some specific rules are described later on in this chapter.
