## Deadly Wounds

When receiving a deadly wound, the Character might die immediately. To avert an
immediate death, the character must win a check against Body, if the deadly
wound is physical, or Mind, if itâ€™s mental. The check has a negative modifier
equal to the current amount of Injury Points, not considering the incoming
deadly wound.

Specific settings might introduce specific death-averting skills, other than
*Body* and *Mind*, and some situation has specific skill to be used instead.
For example, if the deadly wound is coming from poison, the skill to use
instead of *Body* is *Poison Resistance*.

If the check is successful, the instead of being deadly, the wound
becomes heavy.
