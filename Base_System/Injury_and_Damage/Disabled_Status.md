## Disabled Status

When a character receives more wounds than it can sustain, it becomes disabled. 
The following Disabled Status Table describes the seriousness of the disabled
status on humanoids and human-sized animals in common settings:

$(include /Base_System/tables/injury_points.md)

Injury Points
Consequence
Less than 6
Character is disabled but conscious
6-7
Character is unconscious for 2 hours
8-9
Character will die within 2 hours
10+
Character will die within 10 minutes

When a character is disabled, performing any action against it (including
killing it) doesn’t require checks; however, this doesn’t apply if the acting
character is anyhow busy with something else, for example, in a combat.

A disabled character can recover naturally, if the wounds are not serious
enough, otherwise, unless treated, it will die. Treating wounds that can
lead to death on is called “stabilise”. Specific skills, perks and magic
can be used in order to stabilise a disabled character.

The severity of the disabled status depend on how many total injury points 
a character has received before becoming disabled.
