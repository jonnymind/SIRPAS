## Special Injury Rules

Here follow some different _injury rules_ applied to specific type of
characters. Your setting might
have different rules for the same characters described here, as the following
are just examples taken from the basic rules.

* Ghosts (weak): **DL/IP**=4 (can sustain 4 IPs before being disabled); 
  moreover, and any light wound is automatically turned into a serious wound.
* Vampires (low rank): **DL/W**=8. When disabled, if the total count of injury
  points is less than 16, they are forced to retreat and cannot combat until
  healed. If it's higher, they turn into ash.
* Zombies: They are immune to light or serious wounds, but are destroyed when
  they receive a heavy or deadly wound.
 * Orcs: **DL/W** = 6. Also, their _disabled
     status_ table is the same as that for humans with a bonus of 2 points
     (e.g. they are conscious up to 8 injury points).

Below, there are some examples of characters following the
_standard injury rule_ with some special parameters:

* Dragons: They have **DL/IP**=16. This means that
   they can sustain 16 injury points before becoming disabled,
   regardless from the wound count.
* Goblins and Kobolds: Their **DL/W** is 3. It means that they can receive
   3 wounds only before becoming disabled.
