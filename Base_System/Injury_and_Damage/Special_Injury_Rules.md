## Special Injury Rules

As an example and as a base for expansions, we describe here the rules about
wounds and injury points on different type of characters. Your setting might
have different rules for the same characters described here, as the following
are just examples taken from the basic rules.

* Dragons: They can sustain 16 injury points, regardless from the wound count.
* Ghosts (weak): They can sustain 4 injury points, and any light wound is
  automatically turned into a serious wound.
* Goblins and Kobolds: They can receive 3 wounds only before becoming disabled.
* Orcs: They can sustain 6 wounds before becoming disabled, and their disabled
  status table is the same as that for humans with a bonus of 2 points (e.g. they
  are conscious up to 8 injury points).
* Vampires (low rank): They can receive 8 wounds. If the total count of injury
  points is less than 16, they are forced to retreat and cannot combat until
  healed. If the count of injury points is greater than 16, they turn into ash.
* Zombies: They canâ€™t receive light or serious wounds, but are destroyed when
  they receive an incapacitating or deadly wound. When they receive a light or
  serious wound, they are unharmed, but the damage count stays at the level of
  their health (e.g. it becomes easier to inflict a deeper wound).

Some set of rules are standardised, and can be readily applied to a wide range
of characters in the adventure.
