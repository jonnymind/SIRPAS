## Special Injury Rules

Here follow some different _injury rules_ applied to specific type of
characters. Your setting might
have different rules for the same characters described here, as the following
are just examples taken from the basic rules.

* Ghosts (weak): They can sustain 4 injury points, and any light wound is
  automatically turned into a serious wound.
* Vampires (low rank): They can receive 8 wounds. If the total count of injury
  points is less than 16, they are forced to retreat and cannot combat until
  healed. If the count of injury points is greater than 16, they turn into ash.
* Zombies: They are immune to light or serious wounds, but are destroyed when
  they receive a heavy or deadly wound.

Below, there are some examples of characters following the
_standard injury rule_ with some special parameters:

* Dragons: They have **DL/IP**=16. This means that
   they can sustain 16 injury points before becoming disabled,
   regardless from the wound count.
* Goblins and Kobolds: Their **DL/W** is 3. It means that they can receive
   3 wounds only before becoming disabled.
* Orcs: **DL/W** = 6. They can sustain 6 wounds before becoming disabled.
     Also, their _disabled
     status_ table is the same as that for humans with a bonus of 2 points
     (e.g. they are conscious up to 8 injury points).
