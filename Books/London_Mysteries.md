# Introduction {#BaM-gen-introduction}

“London Mysteries” is a Sirpas expansion. It presents the settings of Victorian
London, in the bustling years after the Industrial Revolution, with large space
for adventures, social climbers, intellectuals and engineers to raise to
prominent positions in society.

It is also the theatre of the struggle between occult societies to gain
prominence, and enlarge their influence.

This setting can be the base to play investigative adventures, as Sherlock
Holmes styled private investigators or horror/supernatural oriented stories;
or, like the late Sherlock Holmes novels, any viable mix of the two. 

# Outlook {#BaM-gen-outlook}

London Mysteries takes place in Victorian London of the years between 1880-1899.

It provides an optional, low-magic system called “occultism”, which is mainly
focused on utility/support. Unless you’re dealing with supernatural entities
(i.e. ghosts or demons), you’re probably better shooting an opponent than trying
to curse it. Yet, occultism can make your hand steadier, and give you
that edge that might make the difference.

Similarly, if you’re wound, you might heal with alchemy or ceremonial magic,
but you’re probably safer heading for the nearest hospital.

The supernatural might totally absent, or included in adventures as a mere
flavour, and even treated with contempt and scepticism; or, if you’re more
inclined to Gothic ambient, it might be a central aspect of the adventure.

# Setting 

This chapter describes the overall historical framework from which the setting takes inspiration. 
In particular, it provides a background comprising the organizations, the characters and the general description

# Attributes {#BaM-gen-attributes}


# Skills {#BaM-gen-skill}

Here follows the list of skills specifically used for this setting.


## City Dweller/town (-)

The character knows the target town very well, and is able to use public
transportation (cabs, underground, railway etc.) effectively. 
A successful check allows to shorten any transit by 20%. For example, a success
allows to chase a target to a known destination, anticipating it.

### Detect Clues (mD)

Find small, hidden and almost invisible clues that might pass unobserved on
crime scenes.

A blonde long hair, missing dust, a few grains of cigar ash; anything that
wouldn't be picked up by a pre-forensic police inspection, and requires a very
keen eye and insight on what to search for.

## Horoscope Divination (-)

The diviner can make a precise horoscope on a willing target (trivial
difficulty), or if it has enough information, even on an unwilling one
(normal to very hard, depending on the available information).

A success allows the diviner to know the overall character (in the sense, type
of person) target of the horoscope. It will reveal if it is an upright, honest
character or a born deceiver, or if it’s after power, glory, money, and so on.
However, it cannot reveal what a target is currently up to; for example, evens
characters very likely to be layers could occasionally behave straightly, if
it’s advantageous for them.

## Pistol Duel (D)

The ability to walk at a distance and shot a single-shot pistol at each other.
A normal success indicates a clear winner, but the loser is just scratched and
doesn’t get any wound.

A critical success indicates the loser takes a heavy or deadly wound. To decide
this, perform a second context on Pistol Duel; if the winner wins again, the
wound is deadly; if it loses, it’s heavy.

## Scyte Divination (-)

This is the skill to forecast the future using a crystal ball. It can be
attempted only once per day.

A success will give the attempter a very short and blurry vision of what is
likely to happen in the future. It might be a future the character wants to
avert, or a desired outcome.

Practically, the Master will give an hint about a possible outcome of
upcoming actions, in form of a short description, or as an image.

A critical success will give the diviner a precise vision or a critical hint.

## Sixth Sense (M)

A success will determine wether the character can sense supernatural powers
operating in the vicinity or not.

A critical success will give the character a perfect knowledge of the type
of supernatural phenomenon occurring.

A critical failure will hurt the character for 1 light mental wound.

## Synchronicity (-)

It's the ability to spill / spin off fortunate coincidences at a crucaial time.

The concept was first introduced by Carl Gustav Jung, who noticed how
the fact of _realising_ that "coincidences" are occurring in someone's
experience is actually due to the _subconscious_, marking some facts as more
relevant than others.

## Tailing (-)

This skill allows a character to follow a target without causing any suspicion.
On a normal success, the target will not realise being followed, but the check
must be repeated every 10 minutes, or every stop along the way (whatever comes
first).

A critical success means the tailing has succeeded automatically until
target’s destination.

## Tarot Divination (-)

The skill of divine the future using tarots.  The diviner can use it on itself,
or on another willing target. A success gives the diviner an overall idea about
the current situation of the target, and the possible outcomes.

This comes useful when the situation in which the target is involved is not
clear. For example, the target might be hired or involved into a seemingly
upright task, but have some doubt about the real motifs of the
employer/requester. In this case a tarot divination might reveal the fact
that the character is being tricked into committing evil deeds.




# Combat Styles {#BaM-gen-combat-styles}


## Mentalism

|   |   |
|------|------|
| Cost | 4 CP |
| Modifier | mI |

_Mentalism_ is an extension of the base combat style _concentration_.
A mentalist can use all the maneuvers from mind meld with either the level of
_concentration_ or _mentalism,_ whichever is higher.

| Level | Maneuvers |
|-----|---|
| 1-5 | 1 |

the next attack receives a +1 modifier and +1 **DP** modifier.

### Grief

|   |   |
|------|--------|
| Type | Attack |
| Modifier | -2 |
| Prereq | Mentalism 3 |
| DR | -1 |

On success, the success margin of this maneuver gets added to the next

use any other action other than an attack of _mentalism_ (or _concentration_), 
or if the next attack fails.

### If only you knew me

|   |   |
|------|--------|
| Type | Attack |
| Modifier | -2 |
| Prereq | Mentalism 8 |
| DR | -1 |
| Damage Type | Despair |

This is an attack that has a negative modifier, but on failure,
it blocks any damage incoming from the successful defense.

### Meditation

|   |   |
|------|---------|
| Type | Defense |
| Modifier | -2 |
| Prereq | Mentalism 6 |

A defense that adds the success margin to the damage caused by the next attack,
in this or the next turn.

This maneuver can be used multiple times per turn and it doesn't have a
_diminishing return_, but each time it's used, the previously achieved **DP**
modifier is discarded.




# Magic System {#BaM-gen-magic-system}


## Kabbalah

In London Mysteries, Kabbalah is a utility-oriented, combat-time form of magic,
that builds up as the caster has more time to increase its effects.

Kabbalah is a hermetic knowledge synthesising aspects of reality into formulas
and graphs unveiling the syntax of the Verb of Creation. According with its
doctrine, the Demiurge (the God of Creation) spell reality into existence
through rules and schemas that follow a precise grammar, which the initiate can
and understand. Moreover, knowing how reality is built up, the initiate can also
bend it to its will.

The grammar of reality is organised as a schema of interconnected words, called
the tree of life. On the tree, there are ten locations, corresponding to the
same number of aspects of reality, which the caster navigates by spelling their
name in turn, in order to unlock more powerful magic as the casting progress.

### Mechanics {#BaM-m-kabbalah-mechanics}

To cast a Kabbalah spell, the caster chants the Verb of Creation, the words of
the Kabbalah. At each word spelled, the caster descends from the top of the tree
of life, representing the external, visible aspects of reality, down to its
roots, where the most powerful forces of nature dwell.

To progress to the next location, and unlock a magic effect in the process, the
caster must achieve a successful check (or contest, if the target is hostile),
with a -1 modifier at each subsequent step. A failure indicates that the caster
must start over again, from the top of the tree.

In order to move to a new node in the tree, the caster must spend a quantity of
Mana (spiritual nourishment) equal to the count of steps walked so far, starting
from one. So, to move the first step, it will have to spend 1 mana, 2 mana for
the second, 3 mana for the third and so on. At any time, the caster can
interrupt its walk and start all over again.

Casting a spell, and moving to the next location in the tree of life always
takes a combat turn. It’s not possible to speed up the casting (or slow it
down), except with magical means. This means that this art doesn’t get more
maneuvers as it increases level, and there aren’t advantages giving more than
one maneuver per turn.

If the caster is attacked, it must perform a focus check in order to avoid
breaking the concentration. If the check fails, the caster needs to start from
the top of the tree again, but the modifier and the mana cost are reset to the
initial values as well.

### Stances {#BaM-m-kabbalah-tree-of-life}

Kabbalah has two stances: offensive and defensive. In offensive stance,
progressing forward from the top of the tree of life to its root produces a
negative effect on unwilling targets, while backtracking from the root to the
top will unlock defensive magic to help the caster and its allied. In defensive
stance, it’s the reverse: progressing from top to root will unlock more powerful
defensive spells, and backtracking will generate offensive attacks.

The caster must decide its stance before entering in combat (if not, the GM will
chose one at random); to change stance in combat, the caster must suspend any
activity and dedicate a whole combat turn to the purpose.

Being interrupted during this process follows the same rules as casting: a check
on focus is required to complete the operation successfully.

### Mana {#BaM-m-kabbalah-mana}

Mana is the mythical nourishment for the spirit that the caster needs in order
to use the Kabbalah successfully.

Initially, it is the double of the level of Kabbalah. So, a character with
Kabbalah 10 will start its adventure with a pool of 20 mana.
Once depleted, if the character is in good health (no serious or worse wounds),
and its body is well fed and not suffering any particular fatigue, Mana will be
naturally replenished at the rhythm of the same number of points as the level of
Kabbalah each “day” (complete and satisfactory cycle of sleep and wake), to the
maximum of the double of the Kabbalah level.

Other than the natural recovery, Mana can be found and absorbed in many ways, for example:

* Reading grimoires.
* Praying at sacred locations.
* Resting in power nodes (special locations of the Earth where the primordial power runs more abundant).
* Drinking specifically created elixirs.
* Receiving it directly from supernatural beings.

Generally, once a source of Mana is absorbed, it will become unusable, at least
for the same character. An elixir can be drunk just once, but while a grimoire
can be read as many times as desired, the same character reading it again will
not gain any further nourishment out of it (another character not having read it
yet might, though). Other sources might give off mana to the same characters
after some time; for example, a character might gain some mana by praying at the
same shrine/church/temple every week.

There is no upper limit to the amount of mana that can be accumulated this way;
however, natural recovery will replenish just the portion below the double of the
level of Kabbalah. 

For example, a character with Kabbalah 10 might have accumulated 80 Mana. No
natural replenishment will occur until it uses at least 61 Mana, going below 20.

### Mana excess (Optional)

A character having accumulated Mana for more than 10 times its
level of Kabbalah will start to give off obvious, involuntary and detrimental
signs of its power. For example, it may cause skin burns to people it comes in
touch with, its voice might become unnatural and scary, it might break delicate
objects in its vicinity by just walking by, and so on.

## Spiritism {#BaM-m-spiritism}

Spiritism is a magic system meant to deal directly with
supernatural entitities. It's the ability to connect with, 
and possibly control, the spiritual world of disembodied
souls, demons and angels.

Although it’s possible to fight most supernatural
entities with mentalism, spiritism is far superior at that. It has also some
adventure-oriented utility, and some combat utility as well.
 
### Spiritism Stress Points {#BaM-m-spiritism-stress-points}
 
Connecting with the world of the spirits causes a great stress on the mind of
the spiritist. Each times a skill is used, the caster receives a certain amount
of positive or negative _spiritism stress points_ (**SSP**). 

Trying to contact or control the supernatural entities gives positive points, 
while warding against them or acting against them generates negative points.

The spiritist can sustain an amount of positive or negative **SSP** equal to 
its level of _spiritism_. When the absolute value exceeds that amount, it receives
an amount of mental damage equal to the excess, in absolute value.

For example, a character with _spiritism_ 8 has currently accumulated -6 stress points. 
If it tries to engage in a spell costing -4 **SSP**, it's count of **SSP** will go 
down to -8, and it will receive 2 points of typeless mental damage. 

If it tries the same spell again, being already at -8 **SSP**, it will now receive 4
mental **DP**.

**SSP** are never reset; however, the spiritist can cast specific spells to bring them 
back to a desired level.

### Spell types and Mechanics {#BaM-m-spiritism-spell-types-and-mechanics}

Spiritic magic is divided in the following categories.

* **Invocations** (Inv): prayers to angels, demons or other entities that have a one-time only
effect. It could be a single word of power or a rather long prayer, spawning several turns.
Once the invocation is complete, the effect is released and the **SSP** cost is paid.
* **Summonings** (Sum): the most common type of spiritic spells, they conjure a spirit that will
continouosly provide some special effect for the caster, until banished. The conjuring can be
instantaneous, spawn several turns. Once the summoning is complete, the summoner will pay the
required amount of **SSP** each turn, until the summoned entity is banished. The entity acts
on its own will, and doesn't require any concentration by the caster; however, the caser cannot
cast any other form of magic until the entity is banished.
* **Banishements** (Ban): Attacks spiritual entities with direct damage, or removes them from this
plane of existence entirely.
* **Long Rituals** (Lor): Ritual to contact the spiritual realm, taking more than a minute to set up.
They usually require a proper setup, and are extremely expensive in **SSP**. The effect is released at
the end of the ritual.
* **Utilities** (Uti): Performs actions at combat-time (although, not necessarily
while engaged in combat), which are not directed at harming or protecting a target.


### Interruptions {#BaM-m-spiritism-interruptions}

If the spiritist is interrupted in its casting, it must perform a **focus** check to avoid lose concentration.
If the check fails, the caster pays half the **SSP** cost of the interrupted spell, and no effect is achieved.


## Spritism Spells {#BaM-s-spiritism-spells}

Here follows the list of spiritism spells.

}

Summons a spiritual creature completely under the control of the caster.
The creature will perform any action it is ordered to perform, if possible,
including attacking a given target.

As normal usual, the caster pays the upkeep cost each turn; however, it can
banish the conjured creatrue when it wants.

| Conjured Creature | Cost |

 { "Prereq": "Spi 4",
"Time": "4 turns",
"Target": "Possessed",
"Special": "Exorcises"
}

The target is a creature currently under spiritc possession. On success,
the possessed creature is freed, and the target is exorcied: it is
banished from the area (in a 100 yards radius), and from re-possessing
thes target creature, for the next 24 hours.

### Medianic Question  {LoM-s-spiritism-medianic-question}

"Type": "Uti",
"Cost": "+2",
 { "Prereq": "Spi 1",
"Time": "2 turns",
"Target": "Spirit"
}

Allows to ask a question to a spiritual entity. If the entity is not hostile,
the caster must just perform a check against a difficutly depending on the nature
of the spiritual entity. If it is hostile, the caster must perform a normal attack.

The question must be posed in a form to be answered only by a yes, no, or 
don't know. The spiritual entity is compelled to reply sincerely to the best of
its knowledge; yet, the reply might not be true if the entity itself beleives a
falsehood.

On failure, or if the defense of an hostile entity is successful, the cost of
the spell is doubled, and the spiritual entity is forbidden from answering even
if it would be willing to do so.

Here follows the difficulty table. A "conjured entity" is any entity that has been
successfully conjured through a conjuring ritual.

| Target | Difficulty |
|--------|------------|
| Dead Body | Trivial |
| Zombie    | Very Easy |
| Conjured entity | Easy |

attack is successful, it gains control of the target creature.

To maintain the control, the caster must repeat the attack, and pay the price
at every turn.

While the caster control a target, all the damage received by the target is
transformed into mental damage for the controller. If the target dies, the
controller receives a *deadly wound* of typeless mental damage.

### Seance {LoM-s-spiritism-seance}

"Type": "Lor",
"Cost": "+4 or -4",
 { "Prereq": "Spi 4",
"Time": "30 mins"
}

Conjures a spirit at the presence of the caster. The conjuring is performed
through a simple check, if the spirit is not actively resisting the conjuring,
or by winning a contest against the spirit's **will**.


 Once summoned, the spirit can be
interacted with directly: it can be talked to by all the bystanders, it can
be attacked or banished, hurt or healed and so on. 

The spirit is not compelled in any way; if it is hostile, it might attack the
bystanders. If questioned, it might reply truthfully or lie, according with its
disposition.

Once the summon is complete, the caster pays the spell cost each turn, i.e.
each time the spirit is interacted with. Even so, the caster is free to perform
any action, including using other spiritic spells. 

If the spirit wants to, it will leave when
asked, letting the caster free; if not, the caster, or someone else, will have
to banish the spirit, or destroy it otherwise. 


| Target | Difficulty | Cost |
|--------|------------|------|
| Soul of a Dead Body | Easy | -2 |
| Disembodied Soul | Normal | 2
| Ghost - | Difficult | -3 |
| Demon - Minor | Hard | -4 |
| Angel - Minor | Hard | +4 |

Frightening and vengeful spirits are summoned in the area; all the hostile creatures in the room, or in a 60 feet radius,
must defend against this mental attack or be frightened for the turn, losing all the attacks and sustaining 6 points of
*despair* damage. 

The caster can repeat the attack in the successive turns immediately, without waiting for 3 turns.
