## Simplified Combat {#BaM-m-simplified-combat}

A first option for resolving combat scenes is that of simply using the combat
skills in a normal skill contest.

This is an option for when a small group of opponents (normally, two to six)
are facing each other with _compatible_ fighting skills and weaponry.
For example, you can use this method when two small bands are shooting at
each other using the __firearm__ skill, or involved in a fist fight and
using __brawl__, or taking part in a little __swordfight__ skirmish.

To perform combat as a _simplified combat_, all the participants must use combat 
skills that belong to the same _category_.
For example, a _simplified combat_ can take place when all the characters
use a form of melee unarmed combat, melee armed combat, distance combat,
mental combat and so on.

However, a character can use __Generic Combat Skills__ skill to participate
a fight this way, if they agree. For example, if everyone else is using
__swordfight__, one character that happens to have a sword in its hands,
but not knowing __swordfight__, could use __Generic Combat Skills/slash__
instead, which acts as a sort of base for everyone trying to swing a
weapon.

### Fight Resolution {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-resolution}

The simplified combat starts with a multi-contest; each participant
uses the skill it prefers to use in this context (possibly, the highest one).
If they have a weapon, the characters will also add its __dominance__.

In case the number of points scored in the multi-contest is the same on each side,
repeat the procedure.

The final victory can be granted after a given number of rounds; 1, 3 or 5.
The **GM** will decide how many rounds the fight will last in advance.

The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances. For example, 
a tavern brawl is hardly lethal, and a "friendly" swordfight (i.e. in order 
to subdue or dissuade an opponent) might simply end with the surrender of the
losing party.

If you _want_ to determine the result of winning or losing the fight
with more precision, you _can_ use the following rules.

### Fight Duration {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-duration}

In terms of fight length, each round (multi-contest) lasts a number of
combat turns equal to the number of participants of the largest party.

For example, if three parties with 4, 5 and 6 members respectively are facing
each other, each round will last 6 turns (usually, 10 seconds each, so one minute
per round).

### Fight Continuation {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-continuation}

If the characters so desire, they can continue fighting until the losing party is
ultimately defeated (all of its characters are disabled) or decides to flee.

## Injury Generation in Simplified Combat (optional) {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-injury}

In simplified combat, a losing character receives a number of **DP** equal to the inverse
of its (in)success margin. For example, if it loses with a **SM** of -6, it receices 6 **DP**.

The character can then use any sensible mitigation (armor or skills, if possible) to reduce
the raw **DP**.

A *critical failure* means that the character receives a *heavy wound* automatically.
Notice that, if one party is larger than the other, some of the characters in that party
will not be directly confront a character on the other side; so, the lowest-scoring
characters will be unharmed. However, they may still score a *critical failure* and
receive a wound because of that.
