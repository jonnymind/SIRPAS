## Generic Combat Skills {#BaM-s-generic-combat-skills}

The skills in this sections are combat skills not related with any
_combat style_.

They differ from normal manoeuvres in the fact that they don’t belong to any
style, and as proper skills, they can be learned independently, and targeted by
advantages and perks.
