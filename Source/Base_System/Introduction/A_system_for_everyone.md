## A system for everyone

Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran players.

Who reads this manual and has never heard about role playing games
before will encounter many new terms that have a special meaning in RPG,
as “session”, “adventure”, “campaign”, “world”, “setting”, “character”,
etc. Also, they might need on how to prepare, organise, manage, or
even behave during a session. This is important, but it is not covered
in this manual. This rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible;
all the concepts commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger
internet. 

However, to help the beginners getting on RPG with Sirpas, depending on the
media you’re reading the rulebook, we will:

1.	provide hyperlink to the description of the term. 
2.	highlighting terms with special meaning in RPG. A fast Internet search
   for “RPG” and the highlighted word will  bring you to the description of the term.
3.	Add a box named “For Beginners” near the relevant terms, that experienced
   readers can skip.
   
There are Sirpas expansions dedicated to beginners, and the Sirpas Beginner
Manual which actually helps beginners to successfully set up their first role
playing gaming experiences.
