# Statuses and status points

Characters will sustain negative effects in pools called *statuses*. Most statuses are binary,
i.e. on or off. For example, a character may be *asleep* or *awake*: it's wakeness status may
be on/off.

Some statuses have numeric values, and the character will be negatively affected by
higher status values.

The base system provides the following status pools:

* *Injury pool* (**IP**): direct damage received to the body. 
* *Fatigue pool* (**FP**): damage inflicted to the the physical resistance. 
* *Stress pool* (**SP**): damage inflicted to the mental resistance.

Advanced system can define other status pools; for example, a Lovecraft styled
horror based system may define a separate "sanity pool", that, once depleted,
may make the character to act erratically.

The initial value of the pools depends on the setting and on advantages
or disadvantages that may be acquired.

Unless differently specified, the default value for any status pool in any 
setting is **9**.

When the status pool is depleted, the character becomes *unconscious*, and depending
on the situation, it may die.
