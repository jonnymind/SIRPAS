}

The character has an innate resistance (or vulnerability,
if the value is negative) to elemental attacks. This
constitute the base for the [resistance](#BaM-s-resistance-source)
skill against elemental sources.

This advantage should be granted only in settings where it
makes sense, i.e. as a racial characteristic of a fantasy
race, or for characters genetically engineered, or for
synthetic life forms as androids etc.
