# Mechanics {#BaM-gen-mechanics}

The mechanics are the ways the game works, in terms of what players actually do
to move their characters through the adventures. Formally declaring what a
character does, checking if an action is successful, checking which characters
wins over a contest are all mechanics.

Sirpas mechanics are determined by statistics and checks. 

Statistics are a numeric or qualitative description of some aspect of a
character, for example a value of 12 in strength or a level of expert in lore
knowledge. 

Checks are performed on statistics in order to determine if a character can
succeed in some action the player wants it to perform. They usually consist in
throwing a set of dice and beating an odd which is determined by some statistic;
for example, summing the points from a throw of three dice to the base strength,
and surpass a certain total in order to slam a jammed door. In other cases, the
check succeeds automatically if the relative statistics has a certain minimum
value; for example, in order for the character to know about a certain legend,
it must be at least expert in the relative lore.
