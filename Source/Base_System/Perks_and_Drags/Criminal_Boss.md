## Criminal Boss {#BaM-a-criminal-boss}

Cost: variable.
The character is the leader of a criminal organisation. It has a
relatively large network of criminals that follow his orders, a
consistent wealth and a flux of incoming money. On the other side,
itâ€™s known to relevant police forces, constantly at risk of being
arrested and not always welcome in high social circles.

The size of the organisation determines the cost in terms of points:

$(include /Base_System/tables/criminal_size.md)

This perk grants a modifier of +4 on Intimidate checks and comparisons
against anyone, excluding other characters with the Criminal Boss perk.

Law Enforcer, Criminal Background, Criminal Boss and Criminal are
mutually exclusive: the character can chose only one of them.
