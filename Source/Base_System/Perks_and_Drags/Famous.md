  "Cost": "10/15/20 CP",
  "Prereq": "-",
  "Max": "-"
}

The character is famous and easily identified by its peers.
Also, whoever wants to know about the character, or searching
for it because of any specific reason (i.e. to hire it for
a job, or to hunt it down), can easily find information
about it and its general whereabouts, unless the character
actively disguises and hides.

The cost depends on how famous the character is:

* 10CP: Konw by 1/20th-1/10th of the population; people
  occasionally identify it when walking by, or tells it
  they heard about it.
* 15CP: Konwn by 1/5th of the population. During a day out,
  or a long walk, the character is sure to be recognized,
  and possibly stopped by admirers (or haters).
* 20CP: Known by more than half the poulation. Wherever the
  character goes, it is recognized, and when that happens,
  people flocks to see it.
