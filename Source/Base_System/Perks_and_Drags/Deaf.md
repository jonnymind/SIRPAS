## Deaf {#BaM-a-deaf}

*Cost*: -30 CP

The character is deaf. It can still use this drag even if it has a 
substitute for normal hearing, provided the substitute is just minimising
the disadvantage. For example, having an laptop/tablet/phone that provides
the character with speech-to-text recognition is still being deaf, but
having the ability to communicate telepathically with demonic minions and
use their hearing would invalidate this perk.
