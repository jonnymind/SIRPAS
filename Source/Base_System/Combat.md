# Combat {#BaM-gen-combat}

Combat is an advanced form of contest. In a normal contest, characters
try to win one over another on specific skills. Also in combat, there
the contest is finalized at harming an opponent or defending from an attack.

Sirpas provides several sub-systems to resolve conflicts, increasingly
detailed (and complex):

* *Simplified Combat*: It's a simple way to resolve small combats.
	It consists in a specialized form of _skill contest_ applied to combat
	skills, which takes into account the relative ranking in the contests to
	determine winners, losers, and other possible outcomes.
* *Basic Combat*: It's a sub-system dedicated specifically to combat, using
	the combat skills with specific rules, and takes into account positioning,
	tactical advantages and other combat-specific elements.
* *Advanced Combat*: This is the full fledged combat system, extending the
 	_basic combat_ and using special sub-skills called _manoeuvres_.

You can mix and match these sub-systems in the same adventure, without
limitation. You can either choose one or another depending on the experience
of the players, or their inclinations, or you can base the choice on the
relevance of the combat in the adventure. For example, you could resolve
a brawl erupted in a tavern as a *simplified combat*, to turn to the
*advanced combat* when things get nasty while fighting the guards to escape
a dungeon.
