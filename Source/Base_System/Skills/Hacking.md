## Hacking/System (-; H) {#BaM-s-hacking}

When a character wants to hack a device or a system, it can roll on this to
check if it has the necessary knowledge to hack the system.

Each action requires a different check. A critical failure implies the hacking
has been neutralised and the source identified. A critical success implies that
the character has gained privileged access, and further actions on the same
system will not require a separate check.

The specifics of the system depend on the setting. For some settings, the
hacking skill could be general, while in other settings specific systems will be
identified, and they might require a separate hacking skill.
