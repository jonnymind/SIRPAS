## Endurance (H) {#BaM-s-endurance}

Endurance is the ability to resist long lasting physical strain. A long march,
swimming, carrying weights for a long time etc. requires an endurance check.
Subsequent endurance checks against the same condition are treated as repeated
check (each of them gets a -1 modifier), even if other skills are used
meanwhile.

For example, if a group is taking a forced march and has already passed a check,
is forced to a fight and then resumes the march without any rest, the next
endurance check will have a modifier of -1.

A success indicates that the character is able to continue the effort. In case
of failure, the character needs to try again with the ever increasing repeated
check, until success becomes impossible.

A critical success causes the next repeated check to be won automatically, and
the current repeated modifier is also reduced by 1.

A critical failure indicates that the character is exhausted, and needs to rest.
If it is in a precarious situation, i.e. swimming, walking along a dangerous
mountain trail, it might be forced to roll against a deadly wound or die.
