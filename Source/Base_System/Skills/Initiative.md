## Initiative (D/W; H) {#BaM-s-initiative}

This skill represents the reaction times and determination under pressure of
the character. It is typically used in contests or rankings, to decide who
acts first during a stalemate, but it can be also used in checks. The order
in which a combat turn develops is decided by a ranking on the initiative
of all the involved characters.

The base is either Dexterity or Will, the best of the two.
