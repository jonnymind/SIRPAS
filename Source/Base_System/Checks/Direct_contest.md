## Contest {#BaM-m-contest}

Some actions are performed either in competition or against other characters.
When this happens, a *contest* (**CNT**) must be performed. Both characters (or the
Master in place of NPCs), must perform the equivalent of a *simple check* on
a *normal difficulty*, trying to beat the opponent's roll.

Some contest can be asymmetrical: for example, an attacker will roll on some
attack skill, while a defender will try and prevent the attacker success using
some defence skill. The skill and combat sections describe some possible
asymmetric skills, but players and masters (and other expansions) might come up
with new ones if the situation suggests so.

The character having scored the highest result wins the contest, and the **SM**
is computed for the winner only (and so, it is always positive).

Draws are normally allowed, and they might either mean that a new situation
has taken by both characters having achieved a success at the same time,
or nothing has changed as each character prevented the other from acting. 

For example, suppose that two characters struggle to reach for a weapon during a
brawl, with a contest on dexterity. If they roll a draw, it means both of them
reached for the weapon, and now the situation has changed. A different contest
may now take place: a contest on *strength* to determine who can pull the hardest.
This time, if they have a draw, it means that none of them is able to snitch the
weapon from the other, and they can try again. 

Contests that don't allow draws are specifically indicated by the rules as
*Drawless Contests* (**ndCNT**). In this cases, when a draw is scored, it is
discarded as not performed, and another contest takes place.
