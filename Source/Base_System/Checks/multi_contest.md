## Multi-contests {#BaM-m-multi-contest}

A multi-contest (**mCNT**) is a contest between two or more parties,
each comprising one or more characters. 

In a multi-contest, each party performs a *ranking* on the 
selected skill. Then, the best *check scores* from each party
are compared against each other, and a point is assinged to the
party having the highest *check score* of all. The contest continues
comparing the second-best scores, the third-best scores and so on,
until all the parties have a score to oppose to the others. Draws
are discarded.

The party having scored the higest number of points is the winner;
more than one party has totalized the same number of points, a multi-draw
happens; depending on the context (and on the rules), draw might either
lead to a new situation, or require the whole multi-contest to be repeated.

As there could be negative consequences for the losing parties, each
losing participant will receive a negative *success margin*.

 Notice that a multi-contest between two parties comprising just one 
 character each is almost the same as a *direct contest*, with the 
 difference that, instead of assigning a positive *SM* to the winner, 
 a negative *SM* is assigned to the loser.

**Example**: Three paties, composed of 3, 4 and 5 members respectively,
try to run up a hill before the others. They perform a *multi-contest*
on [running](#BaM-s-running). The rankings in each party result in:
* Party A: 29-23-20
* Party B: 26-25-22-19
* Party C: 28-22-21-18-16

The points are assigned as follows:
* A = 29, B = 26, C = 28 - Point for A
* A = 23, B = 25, C = 22 - Point for B
* A = 20, B = 22, C = 21 - Point for B

Group A has 1 point while group B has 2: group B wins the multi-contest.
However, the first qualified members of group B and C will have a *SM* of
-3 and -1 respectrively, while for what concerns the second qualified,
it's the member of the group A that will have a negative *SM* (-2); also
the second qualified of group C will have a *SM* of -3.

The remaning one member in B and two members in C are not participating in
the *multi-contest*; nevertheless, the most numerous group has an advantage
in having more chances to score high points than the others -- everything else equal.

The effect of the multi-contest in the adventure should reflect its outcome. In this
example, the two highest scores in the ranking might have fumbled on the hill, or grabbed each
other in a brawl, while the two winners of the winning party would have reached the top,
nearly followed by the losers, and at a distance, by the ones excluded from the contest.
