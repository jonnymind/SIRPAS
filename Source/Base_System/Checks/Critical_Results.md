## Critical Results {#BaM-m-critical-results}

Unless specified otherwise, a *success margin* particularly high is
called *critical success* (**CrS**), and one particularly low is called 
*critical failure* (**CrF**).

Unless specified otherwise, critical successes and failures will
result in particularly good or bad outcomes; when not specified by 
the rules or the skill description, the Game Master will determine 
how the outcome exceeds a normal result. 

In a *contest* a *critical success* can be 
scored only by the winning party (as the **SM** can be only positive, and
is assigned to the winner); hence, a contest can't determine **critical failures**.

The following table describes which **SM** are considiered **critical results,
depending on the complexity of the action. *Contests* are considered *normal actions*
on this regard, unless specified otherwise.

$(include /tables/critical.md)

**Optional**: [Automatic results](#BaM-m-automatic-results) 
determine also a critical result: they
are *critical successes* (or failures) regardless of the value of the **SM**. 
For example, a *natural 18* against an action of normal or easier difficulty always
determines a *critical success*.
