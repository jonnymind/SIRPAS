## Simple check {#BaM-m-simple-check}

A *simple check* is a tried whenever a character needs to perform a direct
action that might fail.

For example, to verify if the character can land safely after jumping down from a height, 
it must pass a check on the skill [acrobatics](#BaM-s-acrobatics).

The skill description indicates which actions it covers. When a character wants to perform
an action for which no skill can be applied, attributes are used instead; the Game Master
decide which is the most adequate one.

For example, if a character is trying to extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is
a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, a simple check on *strenght* can be
used.

Normally, a simple check has a *success level* of 21; this means that the *check score* must
be equal or greater than 21.

## Difficulty Modifiers {#BaM-m-difficulty-modifiers}

Actions that are particularly difficult, or simple, have a **SL** different from 21, as indicated in the
following table.

$(include /tables/difficulty.md)

This reference values are referenced by the skills description; many of them describe when actions
are to be considered *easy*, *hard* and so on. When the skill description doesn't specify it,
the Game Master can assign a difficulty modifier depending on the situation.

Instead of the generic difficulty level, some skills can assign determined modifiers;
for example, jumping from a height requires a check on [acrobatics](#BaM-s-acrobatis) with a
modifier that depends on how high is the jump.
