## Simple check {#BaM-m-simple-check}

A *simple check* is a test for the character to be able to perform a certain
action, which requires a certain **skill** to be employed. For example, to verify 
if the character can land safely after jumping down from a height, it must pass 
a *simple check* on the skill [acrobatics](#BaM-s-acrobatics).

The skill descriptions indicate which actions are covered by each of them. When a character 
wants to perform an action not covered by a specific skill, one of its attributres are used instead; 
the Game Master decide which is the most adequate one. For example, if a character is trying to 
extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, 
the Game Master might ask to pass a *simple check* on [strength](#BaM-s-strength).

To **perform** a *simple check* means to throw three dice (or a different number, where the
rules specify it) and sum the result of the rolled dice to the value of the employed skill or
attribute. The rules might specify other modifiers to be applied to specific checks; for example
being injuried applies a penalty to an check that depends on the seriousness of the injury.

The sole result of the dice rolls is called *natural result*, while the grand total of the *natural result*,
skill or attribute value and modifiers is called *check result* (**CR**). To win (or *pass*) a *simple check*, 
the *check result* must be above a score called *success level* (**SL**) that depends on the difficulty of 
the action, according with the following table:

$(include /tables/difficulty.md)

This reference values are referenced by the skills description; many of them describe when actions
are to be considered *easy*, *hard* and so on. When the skill description doesn't specify it,
the Game Master can assign a difficulty modifier depending on the situation.

Instead of the generic difficulty level, which changes the **SL** for the ckeck, 
some skills can assign modifiers against a *normal* action (**SL**=21), depending on some situation;
for example, jumping down from a high place requires a *normal* check on [acrobatics](#BaM-s-acrobatis) 
with a modifier that depends on the height.

### Success Margin {#BaM-m-success-margin}

The difference between the *check result* and the *success level* is called *Success Margin* (**SM**), and
is of crucial importance in most of the rules. The **SM** is 0 or above on success, and less than 0 on failure.

### Automatic Results {#BaM-m-automatic-results}

When a *natural 18* is scored, and if the action is of *normal* difficulty or easier, the *simple check*
is automatically pased, regardless the *check result* being actually above the required **SL** or not.

When a *natural 3* is scored, and if the action is of *normal* difficulty or harder, the *simple check*
automatically fails, regardless the *check result* being actually below the required **SL** or not.

 **Optional:** *easy* actions have an *automatic success* with a *natural 17* or better and *very easy*
 actions with a *natural 16* or better. *Hard* actions fail automatically with a *natural 4* or worse, and
 *very hard* actions with a *natural 5* or worse.
