# Character Points {#BaM-m-character-points}

Character Points (**CP**) express the amount of experience of your character, and with that, the amount of learning (improvement of its statistics) that the character will perform during the adventure, or in between adventures.

Roughly speaking, statistics can be bought, and in some case sold, in exchange with **CP**s.

The amount of **CP**s spent to increase a certain statistic varies depending on the nature of the statistic, and in most cases, also depending on its current level. It is easier to increase low scores, and as the statistic gets higher, it becomes harder and harder to perfect it further.

As statistics are organized in a hierarchy, bying basic ones will influence more statistics related with them; as such
attributes are more expensive than skills, and main attributes are more expensive than secondary ones. 

This means that itâ€™s usually preferable to invest in the desired skills in the beginning, and then increase their 
base at a later time. On the other hands, later adventures typically provide a larger amount of CP per session, so the decision wether to invest on single skills or on more powerful bases, while important, is not as critical as it might seem.

The following table describes how many CP must be spent in order to increase a statistic. Skills have different costs, depending on their complexity; the "level" value refers to the **specific value**, not the total value of the statistic.
