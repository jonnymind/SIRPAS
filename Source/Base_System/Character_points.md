# Character points {#BaM-m-character-points}

Character Points (*CP*) express the amount of experience of your character, and with that, the amount of learning (improvement of its statistics) that the character will perform during the adventure, or in between adventures.
Roughly speaking, statistics can be bought, and in some case sold, in exchange with character points.

The amount of CP that must be spent to increase a certain statistic vary depending on the nature of the statistic, and in most cases, also depending on its current level. It is easier to increase low scores, and as the statistic gets higher, it becomes harder and harder to perfect it further.

Statistics are scored with their base and a specific amount of points assigned to them. For example, the skill sprint is based on dexterity. If the current value of dexterity is 10, and nothing has been invested in sprint, then sprint will be 10 as well. To buy a point of sprint, the character must invest the CP needed to bring it from 10 to 11. Now, if at a later time the character increases its dexterity, the sprint skill will increase as well, as the points previously spent on sprint represent a bonus with respect to the dexterity base.

This means that itâ€™s usually preferable to invest in the desired skills in the beginning, and then increase the base at a later time. On the other hands, later adventures typically provide a larger amount of CP per session, so the decision wether to invest on single skills or on more powerful bases, while important, is not as critical as it might seem.
The following table describes how many CP must be spent in order to increase a statistic. Skills have different costs, depending on the complexity of learning a certain skill.
