## Scyte Divination (-)

This is the skill to forecast the future using a crystal ball. It can be
attempted only once per day.

A success will give the attempter a very short and blurry vision of what is
likely to happen in the future. It might be a future the character wants to
avert, or a desired outcome.

Practically, the Master will give an hint about a possible outcome of
upcoming actions, in form of a short description, or as an image.

A critical success will give the diviner a precise vision or a critical hint.
