## Synchronicity (-)

It's the ability to spill / spin off fortunate coincidences at a crucaial time.

The concept was first introduced by Carl Gustav Jung, who noticed how
the fact of _realising_ that "coincidences" are occurring in someone's
experience is actually due to the _subconscious_, marking some facts as more
relevant than others.
