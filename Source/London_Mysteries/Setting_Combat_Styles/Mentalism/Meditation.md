### Meditation

$(dd cm_mentalism_deep_secrets)
{ "Type": "Defence",
	"Modifier": "-2",
	"Prereq": "Mentalism 6"
}

A defence that adds the success margin to the damage caused by the next attack,
in this or the next turn.

This manoeuvre can be used multiple times per turn and it doesn't have a
_diminishing return_, but each time it's used, the previously achieved **DP**
modifier is discarded.
