### Grief

$(dd cm_mentalism_grief)
{ "Type": "Attack",
	"Modifier": "-2",
	"Prereq": "Mentalism 3",
	"DR": "-1"
}

On success, the success margin of this maneuver gets added to the next
attack **DP**. However, the modifier is lost if the character is forced to
use any other action other than an attack of _mentalism_ (or _concentration_), 
or if the next attack fails.
