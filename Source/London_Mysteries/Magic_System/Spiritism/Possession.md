The caster performs an attack against a mental defense of the defender. If the
attack is successful, it gains control of the target creature.

To maintain the control, the caster must repeat the attack, and pay the price
at every turn.

While the caster control a target, all the damage received by the target is
transformed into mental damage for the controller. If the target dies, the
controller receives a *deadly wound* of typeless mental damage.
