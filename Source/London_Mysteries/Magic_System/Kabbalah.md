## Kabbalah

In London Mysteries, Kabbalah is a utility-oriented, combat-time form of magic,
that builds up as the caster has more time to increase its effects.

Kabbalah is a hermetic knowledge synthesising aspects of reality into formulas
and graphs unveiling the syntax of the Verb of Creation. According with its
doctrine, the Demiurge (the God of Creation) spell reality into existence
through rules and schemas that follow a precise grammar, which the initiate can
and understand. Moreover, knowing how reality is built up, the initiate can also
bend it to its will.

The grammar of reality is organised as a schema of interconnected words, called
the tree of life. On the tree, there are ten locations, corresponding to the
same number of aspects of reality, which the caster navigates by spelling their
name in turn, in order to unlock more powerful magic as the casting progress.
