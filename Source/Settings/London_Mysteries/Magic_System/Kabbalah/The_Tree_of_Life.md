### The Tree of Life {#BaM-m-tree-of-life}

The tree of life indicates how spells are formed. 
The number on the path between nodes indicates the spell that is cast by 
moving between the two nodes. Horizontal paths (3, 9 and 16) have no
preferential direction; they cast the same spell no matter
if starting from the left or the right of the diagram. All other lines have
a preferential downward direction, which will follow the current stance
(offensive or defensive), while moving back from the bottom to the top will
unlock the off-stance effect (the defensive version of the spell when in
offensive stance, and the other way around).
