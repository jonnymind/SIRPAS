Conjures a spirit at the presence of the caster. The conjuring is performed
through a simple check, if the spirit is not actively resisting the conjuring,
or by winning a contest against the spirit's **will**.


 Once summoned, the spirit can be
interacted with directly: it can be talked to by all the bystanders, it can
be attacked or banished, hurt or healed and so on. 

The spirit is not compelled in any way; if it is hostile, it might attack the
bystanders. If questioned, it might reply truthfully or lie, according with its
disposition.

Once the summon is complete, the caster pays the spell cost each turn, i.e.
each time the spirit is interacted with. Even so, the caster is free to perform
any action, including using other spiritic spells. 

If the spirit wants to, it will leave when
asked, letting the caster free; if not, the caster, or someone else, will have
to banish the spirit, or destroy it otherwise.
