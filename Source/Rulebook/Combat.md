# Combat

Combat is an advanced form of contest. In a normal contest, characters
try to win one over another on specific skills, while in combat,
contests are finalized to deal damage or other negative effects on
an unwilling target.

SIRPAS offer three set of rules for resolving combat situations, with 
increasing level of complexity:

- *Simplified Combat*: It's a simple way to resolve small combat situations.
	It consists in a specialized form of [multi-contest](#multi-contest) applied to combat
	skills, which takes into account the relative ranking in the contests to
	determine winners, losers, and other possible outcomes.
- *Basic Combat*: It's a sub-system dedicated specifically to combat, using
	the combat skills with specific rules, and takes into account positioning,
	tactical advantages and other combat-specific elements.
- *Advanced Combat*: This is the full fledged combat system, extending the
 	_basic combat_ and using special sub-skills called _maneuvers_.

You can chose to stick with one combat system or mix and match them the same adventure, 
without limitation, depending on how combat-centric is your adventure, or how
important is a specific combat in your story.
