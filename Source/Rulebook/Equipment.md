# Equipment

For *equipment* we intend whatever material is necessary for a skill to function.
For example, to use (lock picking)[#lock_picking] it is necessary for the characters to have a 
basic lock picking set available. Many combat skills require a specific type of weapons.

Advanced equipment may provide improvements of various nature:

* Provide a flat bonus to some dice roll involved in the skill.
* Reduce the difficulty level of checks.
* Improve the dominance of the combat skill used.
* Provide advantages as described in the manual (i.e. an automatic *mastery*).
* Provide additional side effects as:
  * reducing the noise caused by certain actions
  * introduce poison-like effects
  * produce a curse or a blessing when used
  * provide a passive or active damage reduction when receiving damage

Similarly, poor equipment may have reverse effect; for example, 
making simple actions more difficult, or providing a penalty to any dice roll.

Reasons why equipment may provide non-standard advantages are:

* Manufacture quality
* Magic
* Explicit upgrades
* Setting anachronism (coming from the future / a different place).

## Equipment Categories

Equipment is divided in *categories* (**EC**) which is the type of equipment that may be used
by a certain skill. 

A generic skill may actually use multiple **EC**s; for example, generic
**Shoot** skill may use anything that can be loaded with a projectile, so **EC** could include
firearms and crossbows.

Similarly, a single item may belong to multiple categories; a sniper rifle may be a *firearm* and
also a *precision weapon*.

## Optional Equipment

Some skills do not require to use any equipment, but may benefit from using one. For
example, in a fistfight is possible to fight with bare hands, but when using a device
as a metal gauntlet, the efficacy increases. 

## Generic Items

Not all objects the characters can use, wear or eat are considered "equipment". Anything that
isn't needed by a specific attribute is referred as a *generic item*. This includes:

* Clothing
* Food
* Magic Potions
* Single-use Healing Devices (e.g. stim-shot)
* etc.

In general, anything a character an use or carry but is not directly used by a specific skill or
attribute is a *generic item*.

## Charges and re-charges

Some equipment can be used a limited number of times, after which it either becomes unusable or
needs to be recharged. This is the case of magic scrolls in certain magic settings, that can be
used only once, or pistols that require recharging after their magazine is depleted.
