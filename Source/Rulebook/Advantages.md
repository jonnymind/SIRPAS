# Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific attribute or set
of attribute in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.

For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to automatically win a draw once a day. 
Others may give you extra die to throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra
point to all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all *easy skill checks* based on 
a certain attribute. Others may reduce the difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one
level, so that i.e. a skill called **climbing** on *easy* targets becomes trivial, on *normal* targets it 
becomes *easy* and so on. 

Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be given
disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during
previous adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages have negative CP costs,
a player can chose to get certain disadvantages in order to gain **training tokens** to be
spent elsewhere, in other statistics.

While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have different levels. 
For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level
of all survival checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra reduced difficulty level. 

In that case, the cost to be paid (or refund obtained) of each level is the base cost 
plus the level acquired.

For example, suppose an advantage called **graceful** can be acquired at levels 1 to 3, each level
making the advantage stronger. 
The cost indicated in the description is 2 **TT**/*Primary* (training tokens of type *primary*). 
To buy level 1, the players must spend 2 + 1 = 3 tokens; level 2 costs 2 + 2 = 4, and level 3
2 + 3 = 5 tokens. This means that if players wants to get **graceful**/3 from scratch,
they must use 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 *primary* tokens.

The tokens refunded when acquiring (willfully) a disadvantage follow the same rule, granting
a number of tokens equal to the indicated base cost plus the level the players are willing
to take, cumulated. So, if a disadvantage called **clumsy** has base "cost" 2 **TT**/*Primary* and
can be acquired with level 1 to 3, players giving **clumsy**/3 to their character will receive
3 + 4 + 5 = 12 **TT**/*Primary* to be spent on something else.
 
### Advantage prerequisites

Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. 
For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, or having a certain 
statistic at a minimum set score.

### Other limitations (optional)

The GM may allow to get a certain number of advantages and/or disadvantages to taken at character creation,
or may allow to get some of them later on if that's fitting for the setting. For example, in a cyberpunk
setting, many advantages may be granted through body implants, which may be be bought under certain
conditions.

## Premium advantages

In some cases, a character can receive an advantage as a reward for completing
a certain task. Advantages can be gained by magic, e.g. blessings, or physical conditions, 
e.g. receiving a cybernetic implant by the government as a reward for being enlisted
in a special corp.

Whenever an advantage is a acquired as a reward, that require spending the front
cost in **TT**s

## Removing advantages

It is possible to remove advantages that have become obsolete. If the player so wishes,
it can remove an advantage and recover half its nominal cost in **TT**s (rounded up). 
This doesn't include premium advantages, that is, advantages received as rewards for
in-game deeds.

## Penalty disadvantages

In some cases, a character can receive a disadvantage unwillingly. This may be
caused by magic, e.g. curses, or physical conditions, e.g. a necessary
cybernetic component of their body becoming unserviceable or being hijacked by
a malignant hacker.

Whenever a disadvantage is a acquired as a penalty, that doesn't give any
additional **TT**.

## Removing disadvantages

It is possible to remove disadvantages that the players have willfully 
applied on their character. This can be done by:

* paying back double the cost of the disadvantage in equivalent **Training Tokens**, or
* by performing particularly worthy tasks in game, aimed directly at reducing or
removing the disadvantage. For example, a player may save a famous cybernetic scientist
in exchange for his help removing a defective cyber implant. This can remove also
*penalty disadvantages*.

If the disadvantage has levels, each level needs to be removed separately: it's
necessary to pay double the tokens received by acquiring each level, one by one, 
before being able to remove the disadvantage completely. 

For example, if a **clumsy**/3 disadvantage, with base cost 2 **TT**/*Primary* granted
3 + 4 + 5 = 12 tokens, to remove it players must pay 24 **TT**/*Primary*.

## Conflicting advantages

Characters cannot acquire advantages having opposite effects to disadvantages they own,
and the other way around, they cannot acquire disadvantages conflicting with advantages
they already own.

If a game situation applies a *premium advantage* or a *penalty disadvantage* to a character
already having a conflicting advantage or disadvantage, that one is removed instead.

For example, suppose that the advantage **graceful** has the opposite effect of **clumsy**:
it acts on the same skills and checks, but the first gives a bonus while the second
inflicts an opposite penalty. In this situation, if a character having **graceful** is
hit by **clumsy** because of the effect of a curse, **graceful** is removed instead.

If the conflicting advantages are leveled, the character is left with the larger 
of the two, reduced of the value of the other. For example, if a character with
**clumsy**/1 is receive a blessing that would grant **graceful**/3, then
**graceful**/2 is applied instead.

This happens also if the to statistics are not exactly specular, but just
acting in opposite direction on the same skills or checks. For example,
if **expert** reduces the natural penalty of *normal*, *hard* and *very hard* checks for
a certain skill while **novice** increases the penalty of *trivial* checks only,
they are still considered conflicting under this rule. However, they would not
be considered conflicting if they affect different skills.

## Skill specific disadvantages

Some disadvantage can target specific skills and checks, making them harder
or weaker for the character afflicted by it.

In general, the **GM** should allow players to acquire the disadvantage
in exchange for tokens only if it's actually relevant for them:

* On a skill that is very commonly used by everyone in-world, as a hacking
skill on a AI or cyberpunk setting, or a fist fighting skill in a fantasy world.
* On a skill that is relevant for the in-world occupation of the player,
as for example thievery skills for thieves and spies, healing skills for
healers and so on.

The idea here is that of not giving "free upgrades" for the players to use
without consequences.

This doesn't *necessarily* apply to *penalty disadvantages*, that players may be subject
to because of something happening during their adventure. For example, a
player may receive a light curse that afflicts a specific skill by design, which
may or may not be relevant for the character.
