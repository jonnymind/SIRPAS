# Advantages and Disadvantages {#RB-advantages}

Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific attribute or set
of attribute in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.

For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to automatically win a draw once a day. 
Others may give you extra dice to throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra
point to all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all the skills based on 
**Dexterity**. Others may reduce the difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one
level, so that i.e. easy pickpocket targets become trivial, normal targets become easy and so on. 

Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be given
disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during
previous adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages have negative CP costs,
a player can chose to get certain disadvantages in order to gain **CP** to be
spent elsewhere, in other statistics.

While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have different levels. 
For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level
of all survival checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra reduced difficulty level. 

In that case, the description of the advantage indicates the initial cost and the cost per additional level. 
The cost of a further level is given by the base cost, plus the additional level cost times the current level. 
For example, if the description indicates the cost in **CP** being 5+2, it means that the first level costs 5, 
the second 5+2*1 = 7, the third 5+2*2 = 9 and so on.

Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. 
For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, or having a certain 
statistic at a minimum set score.

The GM may allow to get a certain number of advantages and/or disadvantages to taken at character creation,
or may allow to get some of them later on if that's fitting for the setting. For example, in a cyberpunk
setting, many advantages may be granted through body implants, which may be be bought under certain
conditions.
