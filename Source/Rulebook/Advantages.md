# Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific attribute or set
of attribute in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.

For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to automatically win a draw once a day. 
Others may give you extra die to throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra
point to all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all the *easy skills* based on 
**Dexterity**. Others may reduce the difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one
level, so that i.e. pickpocket on *easy* targets becomes trivial, on *normal* targets it 
becomes *easy* and so on. 

Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be given
disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during
previous adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages have negative CP costs,
a player can chose to get certain disadvantages in order to gain **training tokens** to be
spent elsewhere, in other statistics.

While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have different levels. 
For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level
of all survival checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra reduced difficulty level. 

In that case, each additional level cost one additional training token of the same type.

For example, suppose the advantage **graceful** has 3 levels, which gives 1, 2 or 3 points
fixed base on any *easy* dexterity based skill, depending on the level. 
The cost declared is 2 **TT**/*Primary* (training tokens of type *primary*). 
To achieve the second level of **graceful**, the character must use 3 **TT**/*Primary*,
and for the third level they must spend 4 **TT**/*Primary*.

### Advantage prerequisites

Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. 
For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, or having a certain 
statistic at a minimum set score.

### Other limitations (optional)

The GM may allow to get a certain number of advantages and/or disadvantages to taken at character creation,
or may allow to get some of them later on if that's fitting for the setting. For example, in a cyberpunk
setting, many advantages may be granted through body implants, which may be be bought under certain
conditions.
