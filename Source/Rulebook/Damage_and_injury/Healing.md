## Healing

The **IP** generated by wounds (and relative check penalties) affect the
characters until they are healed. Wounds are healed one-by-one, unless
a general healing procedure is applied (i.e. a magic spell that restores
the character health completely, a backup-restore procedure on an AI etc.)

As a wound is cured through any mean (medicine, magic, natural healing etc.), 
its **IP** cost and relative check penalty are removed.

Light and serious wounds heal naturally after a reasonable amount of time.
Common sense can be used by the Game Master and the players to determine
the adequate time; for humans, a light wound may heal completely in less
than a week (generally, after a day of full rest and basic treatment), 
while a serious wound would take about month (or a week of full rest and
basic treatment).

Heavy wounds require specific treatment to be cured.

### Healing Scratches

Scratches not turned into a light wound are removed after a reasonable amount of time
and minimal care adequate to the setting. For example, in a fantasy setting, that may
be spending a few minutes to tend the wounds after a combat. In a cyberpunk setting, 
it may be applying wound-reducing foams. 

### Day-rest healing

Unless differently specified by the modules a full day of rest and basic tending 
will:

* Heal all scratches not counted as light wounds;
* If there character hasn't got any scratches, heal 1 light wound.
