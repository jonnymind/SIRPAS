## Healing

The **IP** generated by wounds (and relative check penalties) affect the
characters until they are healed. Wounds are healed one-by-one, unless
a general healing procedure is applied (i.e. a magic spell that restores
the character health completely, a backup-restore procedure on an AI etc.)

As a wound is cured through any mean (medicine, magic, natural healing etc.), 
its **IP** cost and relative check penalty is removed.

Light and serious wounds heal naturally after a reasonable amount of time.
Common sense can be used by the Game Master and the players to determine
the adequate time; for humans, a light wound may heal completely in less
than a week, while a serious wound would take a month.

Heavy wounds require specific treatment to be cured.

Scratches not turned into a light wound are removed after a reasonable amount of time
and minimal care adequate to the setting. For example, in a fantasy setting, that may
be spending a few minutes to tend the wounds after a combat. In a cyberpunk setting, 
it may be applying wound-reducing foams. 

**Optional**: in any setting, the equivalent of a day of rest should clear any scratch.
