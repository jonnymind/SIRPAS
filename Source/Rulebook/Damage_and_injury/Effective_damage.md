## Effective Damage

Incoming *raw damage* is modified through the application of *defenses*, 
that reduce it in various ways; they are mainly divided in the following categories:

- *Passive Defenses*: reducing the incoming **DP**s of a flat amount (like physical armors),
  or dividing the damage by a certain factor, i.e. 4/5 or 3/4 (like magic or sci-fi shields),
  or eventually by an hybrid formula (as in the case of specific resistances against some
  kind of damage).
- *Active Defenses*: the amount of reduced **DP**s depends on the use of a certain
  character ability. 

The way different kind of damages impact on the characters is fully considered by the way
defenses are applied to reduce the incoming **DP**s.

The count of **DP**s left after the defenses are applied is called 
*effective damage* (**ED**).
