## Localized Wounds

By default, wounds are generally directed in the generic direction of the body,
but some abilities allow to aim a certain specific part of the body.

### Wounds to limbs or periferical devices

When a wound is localized on a specific body part (an arm, a leg), 
any action involving that body part receives the double amount of
penalty from that wound type (that is; the same amount of penalty
as the number of injury points that part has received). 

For instance, a *heavy wound* localized on a leg will cause 4 *IP* as normal, 
resulting in a penalty of -2 points to any check, but the penalty will be
-4 or any skill involving jumping, running and using specifically the legs.

This extends to non human and even virtual body parts as well: and AI receiving
a heavy wound on a virtual device will have a double penalty if it tries to use
that device to perform any action.

### Wounds to the head or control unit

When a wound affects the head (or other target part that is particularly critical
to control the behavior of the target), it generates an additional **injury point**.
*Light wounds* generate 2 *IP*, while *medium* and *heavy wounds* generate 3 and 5
**IP** respectively.
