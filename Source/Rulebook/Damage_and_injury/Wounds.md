## Wounds

When sustaining a certain amount of damage, the character
receive a certain kind of wound, according with the following table:

$(include /tables/wounds_severity.md)

Wounds are of the same type of the damage received. For example,
physical damage generate a physical wound; mental damage causes
mental wounds and so on. 

The severity of the received wound and its type determine the amount and type 
of *injury points* (**IP**) currently sustained by a certain character;
once the **IP**s are above the maximum damage of a certain type 
a character can sustain, it becomes *incapacitated*, and it may 
eventually die, if the wounds are not treated.

### Wounds Penalty

A character receives a penalty to any check of half the sum total of
**IP**s across all types (rounded down). 

While the type of the wounds its relevant for the amount of damage that
can be sustained, that doesn't matter for how well the character is
performing. You are not going to find a new theorem with an untreated broken
arm, and your fighting style will be less than effective if your
mind is in shambles.

### Scratches

A character receiving an *effective damage* greater than 0, 
but below the amount necessary to generate a wound receives a "scratch".
 
Scratches are extremely light wounds that, by themselves, don't impact
the character **IP** pool.

However, once received a certain number of scratches, they are considered
as one light wound. The number is determined by the **scratch resistance** (**SRes**)
to that damage type, which is defined by each module.

### Non-scratches (optional)

When the damage received is mitigated to the point to be insignificant, 
it doesn't generate a scratch.

Unless the module specifies differently, when the **ED** is -3 or less, 
that isn't accounted as a scratch. However, it may still generate negative effects,
for example apply any form of physical or magical poisoning, inject a virus in an AI
or in a cyber brain and so on.
