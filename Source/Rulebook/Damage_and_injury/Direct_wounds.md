## Direct Wounds

In some situation, a character can receive a wound of a certain kind directly,
(not just as a consequence of receiving a certain amount of **damage points**).

For instance,
certain magic spells could cause a heavy wound directly if the character fails
an attempt to resist them. A overwhelmingly powerful weapon, for example a starship
laser directed against a human, could have the same effect. Explicit actions 
performed on the character when it is unable to defend itself could deal
an arbitrary wound as the attacker seems fit, etc.

Direct wounds will immediately apply the relative **injury points** as if they were
received through damage application.
