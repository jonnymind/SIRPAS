## Direct Wounds

In some situation, a character can receive a wound of a certain kind directly,
and not as a consequence of receiving a certain amount of **damage points**. 

For instance,
certain magic spells could cause a heavy wound directly, if the character fails
an attempt to resist them. A overwhelmingly powerful weapon, for example a starship
laser directed against a human, could have the same effect. Explicit actions 
performed on the character when it is unable to defend itself 
(i.e. forms of physical or mental torture) could deal
an arbitrary wound as the attacker seems fit, etc.

Direct wounds will immediately apply the relative **injury points** as if they were
received through damage application.



### Curing wounds

As a wound is cured through any mean (medicine, magic, natural healing etc.), 
its **IP** cost is removed.

Scratches not turned into a light wound are removed after a reasonable amount of time
and minimal care adequate to the setting. For example, in a fantasy setting, that may
be spending a few minutes to tend the wounds after a combat. In a cyberpunk setting, 
it may be applying wound-reducing foams. 

**Optional**: in any setting, the equivalent of a day of rest should clear any scratch.
