## Damage Points

The *raw damage* a character receives is measured in *damage points* (**DP**).

Damage can come in the way of characters in various forms, and from various
sources; hence, **DP** have also a *quality*, which depends on which source
is generating them.

A source could be physical harm, fatigue, heat, cold, mental stress etc., as
your module requires.
