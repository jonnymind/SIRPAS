## Resistance check

In some situation, it's possible to avert the received damage partially
or completely using a **resistance check** (**RC**). 

The resistance check is a **simple check** with a difficulty modifier
determined by seriousness of the damage that is being averted.

@(include /tables/resistance_difficulty.md)

For example, suppose a character is hit with a deadly poisonous dart.
To avert immediate death, they must perform a **RC** against poison
with *very hard* difficulty.

It's not normally possible to avert non-lethal damage during combat using
a **resistance check**, unless specific advantages or other
module-specific rules provide this ability.

The attribute used for **RC**s is the most detailed one that can be applied
in the situation. 

Suppose for example that a module defines hierarchy the attributes:

```
Body -> Metabolism
Spirit -> Willpower -> Fear Resistance.
```

In this situation, **Metabolism** would be used to resist poison, while
**Fear Resistance** would be used to avert damages and negative effects
caused by any **fear** based attack.

In general, the attribute description gives a generic indication on which
type of damage it can avert; so the fact that **Metabolism**
could be used to resist poison damage (and maybe some other negative
effects) would be indicated in its description. 

At any rate, the Game Master can pick any attribute that would be relevant,
and ultimately, the most basic attributes if a specific one can't be found.

> The base module defines **resistance** skills covering all the damage
sources it introduces.
