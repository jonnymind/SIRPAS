## Incapacitation

The amount of **injury points** that incapacitate a character is defined
by the modules, and can be tweaked by the Game Master to better fit the
mood of its campaign.

A realistic setting may set the limit for humans to 4 or 5 heavy wounds,
or equivalent amount of ligher wounds (that would be 16 or 20 points),
but if characters are something different from humans (e.g. vampires,
werewolves, android etc.) they might have a greater resistance to pain
and/or damage.

Normally, a count of 20 **IP** would give a penalty of -10 to any check,
which may be severely limiting even for a powerful character; however,
the modules provide means to reduce or ignore the penalty under certain
situations with advantages or special gear, as enchanted armors, stim shots,
magic spells, nanomachines etc.
