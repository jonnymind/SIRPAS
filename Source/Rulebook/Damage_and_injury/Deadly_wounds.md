## Deadly Wounds (optional)

When a character receives more than 9 *ED* points, it sustains a wound that is
potentially able to kill them immediately.

To avert an immediate death, the character must pass a _simple check_ on an
attribute related with the type of damage received.

If the check is successful, the character receives a _heavy wound_.

> Remember that the _resistance check_ has a negative modifier of half the
received **IP**s, as any other action.
