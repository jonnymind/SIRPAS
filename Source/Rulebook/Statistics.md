# Statistics

In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that define a characters. 
They are divided in the following categories:

- [Attributes](#attributes): important aspect of the character on which many other mechanics depend. 
  For example *body*, *strength*, or *spirit* could be attributes in many game worlds.
  **Skills** are special **attributes** used to perform specific actions, 
  as *hacking*, *lock picking*, *running*, *climbing* etc.
- [Statuses](#statuses): values that vary fluidly during an adventure; for example,
  to keep track of the current health of a character you can look at its **injury points**.
- [Vantages](#vantages): **Advantages** or **disadvantages** targeting either the
  rules as a whole or improving a specific attribute in some way. For example, some advantages
  allows you to throw more die in some situation, others may reduce the difficulty
  of actions performed with a certain skill.
- [Backgrounds](#backgrounds): distinctive traits setting the character apart from the 
  background people in the setting; for example, being "famous" or "outlaw". 
  They have an impact in the adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly 
  some checks, providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.
