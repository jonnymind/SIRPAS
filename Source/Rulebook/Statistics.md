# Statistics

In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that define a characters. 
They are divided in the following categories:

* **Attributes**: important aspect of the character on which many other mechanics depend. 
  For example *body* (**B**), *mind* (**M**), *health* (**H**) and *will* (**W**).
  **Skills** are special **attributes** used to perform specific actions, 
  as *hacking*, *lock picking*, *running*, *climbing* etc.
* **Statuses**: values that vary fluidly during an adventure; for example,
  to keep track of the current health of a character you can look at its **injury points**.
* **Advantages**/**disadvantages**: Statistics affecting other skills, as example an expert 
  modifier which increase the chance of winning checks against a specific skill. 
* **Perks**/**drags**: distinctive traits setting the character apart from the 
  background people in the setting. Could be things a "famous" or "criminal". 
  They have an impact in the adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly 
  some checks, providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.
