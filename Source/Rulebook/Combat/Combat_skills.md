## Combat skills

Every form of combat is based on special attributes called **combat skills**.
They represent the proficiency of a character in fighting. 

Skills like (for example) **archery**, **gunslinging**, **kung-fu dragon style**, 
**battle hacking** or **punching**, or in general, any natural, codified or 
semi-codified way to perform a fight in the adventure setting are **combat skills**. 

**Combat skills** work similarly to any other skill in the system, with
the addition of the following characteristic:

* **Range type** (**Rt**): Can be **melee**, **ranged** or **Metaphysical**. 
* **Actions**: Some skills can be used multiple times in a combat turn. For example,
  a nimble skill having 3 **actions** would allow the character to attempt 3 attacks,
  or move, switch weapon and attack, all in the same turn.
* **Dominance** (**Dom**): a value roughly describing the effectiveness of the skill
  in a mixed combat, given opponents of the same skill level. 
* **Style**: A set of specific ways to use the combat skill, called **maneuvers** 
  causing special effects to take place during the combat 
  (used in the _advanced system_ only). 
  
### Generic combat skills

Trying to attack any target against their will should always involve 
a **combat skill**, even when not using a codified style of fighting. 

For example, a non-trained character may still just pick up a blunt
weapon and swing it, or pull a trigger of a loaded fire arm, or simply
try and punch someone, without a specific proficiency in a martial art or
any other experience about a specific way to fight.

The modules provide a set of "natural" **generic combat skills**, that
work as a default skill used when trying to attack someone without any specific
training. Of course, they are less effective than specific combat skills, but
they are also cheaper to train.

Also, **generic combat skills** always have a **dominance** of 0, **actions** of 1
and they  don't have an associated **style**, that is,
they cannot be used to execute any special **maneuver** in the advanced 
combat system.

### Skill Range

Combat skills are divided into _melee_, _ranged_ and _metaphysical_.

* _Melee_ skills work when the combatants are in close range, and can
   physically harm each other without any projection.
* _Ranged_ skills use a weapon, a projectile or any mean to physically
   project a harmful device or source of energy towards a target. Skills of
   magical nature might be ranged if they magically create a projectile, ray
   of energy or any physical mean to harm a target.
* _Metaphysical_ skills require their user to know where a target is in order
   to direct the attack, but they have no physical range. The target could be
   on another planet, as long as the user has a mean to see, feel or simply
   know _instantly_ about it.

### Dominance

The **dominance** (**Dom**) of a combat skill describes its effectiveness
in a mixed combat, given opponents of the same skill level. 

For example, in a certain setting **archery** skill may have **Dom**3, 
while **gunslinging** has **Dom**6; this means that a gunslinger would 
way more effective than a comparably competent archer on the battlefield.

Dominance is mostly used in the *advanced* combat system, but is also used
when mixing combat styles in the other systems. Whenever different combat
styles are employed, the **dominance** value of each skill is added to
every roll.

> For example, suppose a brawl fight
takes place in a tavern, and the town guards, armed with their crossbows, turn
in to stop the fight. As far as the combat skills go, the guards are using **archery**, 
while the brawlers are using **brawl**. While guards are less experienced in 
their **archery** than tavern goers are in their **brawl**, **archery** has an
innate advantage: its **Dom** may be somewhere around 3, while **brawl** **Dom** could
be 0 or 1. To resolve any fight, everyone will then add the value of the **dominance**
of they skill they want to (or can) use to every roll they take.

### Styles and maneuvers
  
In the _advanced combat system_, **Combat skills** are associated with a _style_, that is a collection
of actions that can be done using the skill (called **maneuvers**).

**Maneuvers** are not stand-alone skills, and they cannot be target of advantages or perks.

The same combat style can also cover different kind of weapons, with some
specific maneuvers limited to some weapons. For example, a combat skill may be
**Firearms**, covering any kind of modern firearm, and its style may include maneuvers as 
**rapid reload**, which applies only to pistols, and **sniping**, which applies only to
precision rifles.

Maneuvers have the following statistics:

* Type: can be **attack**, **defense** or **action**.
* Modifier: positive or negative bonus to the combat skill for any type of roll.
* Prerequisite: minimum level of other attributes/skills required to perform this maneuver.
* Diminishing Return: modifier to the roll if using the same maneuver more than once in a row.
* Range: If the combat skill is ranged, the distance at which this maneuver is effective.
* Damage: How many **DP** the maneuver inflicts if successful. Defenses and actions can have
  generate damage as well (i.e. counter-attacks or actions causing indirect damage).
* Status: a status alteration of the target if the maneuver is successful (i.e. causing
  the target to be *stunned* for 2 turns, and so on).
