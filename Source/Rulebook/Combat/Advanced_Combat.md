## Advanced Combat

Advanced Combat is the most sophisticated combat sub-system; it expands the
basic combat system by adding a set of sub-skills for each combat skill,
called **maneuvers**. They represent special actions a character can take while using
the combat skill.

There are specific maneuvers to attack and defend in each style, and each of
them has different balances of difficulty of execution versus potential damage,
or different effects on the reset of the combat. Some maneuvers provide
modifiers to subsequent moves, while some other generate damage also
when defending.

### Maneuver types

Maneuvers are divided into _attacks_, _defenses_ and _actions_. Attacks and
defenses represent a mores specific usages of the base combat skill as
per the _base combat_ rules; _actions_ are other ways a combat skill can be employed.

### Maneuver Cost and Combat Resource

Each maneuver requires to spend a certain amount of **Advanced Combat Resources** (**ACR**) to be
successfully performed. The pool of ACR depends on the **Main** attribute on which the combat type
relies on (physical, mental, magical etc.), and is replenished at the end of the combat.

Once the pool is depleted, the character can perform only the basic maneuvers of the given combat style,
which has a cost of 0 **ACR**, and usually consists of the same basic action that could be performed in the
base combat.
