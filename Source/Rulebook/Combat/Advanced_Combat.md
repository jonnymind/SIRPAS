## Advanced Combat

Advanced Combat is the most sophisticated combat sub-system; it expands the
basic combat system by adding a set of sub-skills for each combat skill,
called **maneuvers**. They represent special actions a character can take while using
the combat skill.

There are specific maneuvers to attack and defend in each style, and each of
them has different balances of difficulty of execution versus potential damage,
or different effects on the reset of the combat. Some maneuvers provide
modifiers to subsequent moves, while some other generate damage also
when defending.

### Maneuver types

Maneuvers are divided into _attacks_, _defenses_ and _actions_. Attacks and
defenses represent a mores specific usages of the base combat skill as
per the _base combat_ rules; _actions_ are
other ways a combat skill can be employed.

### Maneuver modifier

Some maneuvers are more difficult than others; some rely on brute force, others
on finesse of execution. To reflect this, each maneuver can offer different
modifiers to the various combat skill rolls.

### Diminishing Returns

Some maneuvers get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly against the same
target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has diminishing returns: your
opponent will read your move, and will be able to better defend against the same
attack. In those situations, youâ€™ll want to be less predictable, and use other
maneuvers, or other styles altogether.

This factor is called __diminishing return__ (**DR**) for a certain maneuver.
