## Simplified Combat {#BaM-m-simplified-combat}

This combat system can be used to resolve fights between small group of opponents
are facing each other with _compatible_ fighting skills and weaponry.
For example, you can use this method when two small bands are shooting at
each other using using a **firearm** or similar skill, or involved in a fist fight and
using **brawl**, or taking part in a little __swordfight__ skirmish. 

It is also possible for parties to use different, but somewhat compatible skills. 
For example, in a medieval tavern fight, guards may interrupt a brawl using armed
combat of some sort, or in a modern setting, someone may pull out a firearm during
a bar fight, of some participant may not be confident in brawling and use
a **generic combat skill** and swing pieces of broken furniture around.

In this cases, each participant will add the **dominance** value of the combat
skill they're using. 

### Fight Resolution {#RB-simplified-combat-fight-resolution}

The simplified combat is a modified repeated multi-contest without draws.

The **GM** and/or the player decide how many rounds the fight will last in advance,
so that the best out of 1, 3, 5 (or more) rounds wins the fight.

Each turn, every participant uses the skill it prefers to use in this context 
(possibly, the best one). If the participants use different skills, 
they add their respective **dominance** to their throw.

On party draws (same number of points scored by each party), the throws are
repeated.

The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances. For example, 
a tavern brawl is hardly lethal, and a "friendly" swordfight (i.e. in order 
to subdue or dissuade an opponent) might simply end with the surrender of the
losing party. If that's not the case, both winner and losers may receive 
damage (with the losers generally receiving more).

## Injury Generation in Simplified Combat (optional) {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-injury}

In simplified combat, a losing character receives a number of **DP** equal to their
(negative) success margin. For example, if it loses with a **SM** of -6, 
it receives 6 **DP**. 

> Reminder: each success margin is computed with respect to the throw having the same ranking
in the other team. Highest throw in team A is compared with highest of team B, second highest
of A with second highest of B and so on.

The character can then use any sensible mitigation (armor or skills, if possible) to reduce
the raw **DP**.

A *critical failure* means that the character receives a *heavy wound* automatically.
Notice that, if one party is larger than the other, some of the characters in that party
(the ones with the lowest scores) will not be engaged directly in the fight; so, the lowest-scoring
characters will be mostly unharmed. However, they may still score a *critical failure* and
receive a wound because of that.

> As all the other rules about damage, **Injury Point** penalty applies to the simplified combat
as well. 

### Fight Duration {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-duration}

In terms of fight length, each round (multi-contest) lasts a number of
combat turns equal to the number of participants of the largest party.

For example, if three parties with 4, 5 and 6 members respectively are facing
each other, each round will last 6 turns (usually, 10 seconds each, so one minute
per round).

### Fight Continuation {#BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-continuation}

If the characters so desire, they can continue fighting until the losing party is
ultimately defeated (all of its characters are disabled) or decides to flee.
