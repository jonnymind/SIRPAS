Brawl is the style of fight with bare hand and feet, without a specific
preparation. Itâ€™s often used in tavern and bar fights, and can also be
useful in other combat situations.

Every human or humanoid character has access to brawl.

Unless differently specified, all attacks from **brawl** deal _blunt_
damage, and all the maneuvers are melee.

### Advanced Combat

*Brawl* uses **Stamina** as combat resources, which is determined by the **Body**
primary attribute.
