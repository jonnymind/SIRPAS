}

This skill is used to try and block an opponent in *close quarters*. 

If the opponent is unaware, the attempt will succeed with a **CHK** 
at *easy* level.

In combat, the opponent can use any melee defense. In that case,
a **CFR** between **Blk** and the defense is attempted.

Normally, the block lasts one turn; then the opponent can try 
to [break free](#break-free) or any 
relevant melee defense to exit the block.

A critical success indicates that the blocker has completely
subdued the opponent, that will be unable to break free unless
the blocker is forced to remove the block.

Multiple characters can attempt to block the same opponent; in that
case, a **RNK** is attempted. All the characters scoring higher than
the defendant will be actively engaged in the block.
