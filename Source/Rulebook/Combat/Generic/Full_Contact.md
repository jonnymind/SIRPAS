}

An advanced version and extension of Brawl. While still not being a full-fledged
martial art, itâ€™s a style of combat that requires dedication, and if
professionally trained, can be quite effective even against more famous martial
arts.

A character using Full Contact can use all the maneuvers from *Brawl* under
*Full Contact* instead (whichever has the higher level).

All damage from *full contact* is of __blunt__ type, unless differently
specified.

### Advanced Combat

*Full Contact* uses **Stamina** as combat resources, which is determined by the **Body**
primary attribute.
