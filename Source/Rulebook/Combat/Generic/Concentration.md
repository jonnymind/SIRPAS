Concentration is a simple mind-oriented fighting style, which can be seamlessly
integrated in a traditional melee fight. It covers the role of the default
combat style for mental combat, analogous to brawl for physical combat. In a
world where mental fight is a thing, everyone should be able to mind meld, like
everyone is able to brawl in physical worlds.

While other fighting styles in the manual are realistic, this requires a setting
specifically supporting mind powers. However, the style is suitable for sci-fi
settings to handle fights between AIs, robots, hackers and so on, with
low-resolution.

### Advanced Combat

*Concentration* uses **Focus** as combat resources, which is determined by the **Mind**
primary attribute.
