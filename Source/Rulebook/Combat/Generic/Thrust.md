}

A generic maneuver performed with any pointed or cutting weapon,
(always causing __cut__ damage),
including improvised ones. The character thrusts the weapon forward.

If the opponent is unaware, the skill requires a successful **CHK**
against *easy* difficulty.

In combat, a normal **CFR** is attempted against the opponent's defense.
