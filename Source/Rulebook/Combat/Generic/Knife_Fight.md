Fighting with knives and very short swords has different mechanics than the ones used when wielding a longer blade. Basically, itâ€™s like having a fist armed with a single fang.
While the weapon themselves could be less effective than longer ones, the style itself can be extremely effective in every scenario.
Knife fighting is particularly adequate for characters with a high dexterity.

### Advanced Combat

*Knife Fight* uses **Stamina** as combat resources, which is determined by the **Body**
primary attribute.
