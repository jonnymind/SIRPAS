# Damage and Injury

A critical aspect of any RPG is the set of rules that determine how characters
sustain damage and receive injuries.

SIRPAS has a modular injury system, which can be fitted in any setting and play styles.

It can be used to determine an overall result of a fight, or to determine precisely 
which part of a human body, mechanical robot, flying mount or AI virtual device 
has been damaged, and to what extent it has been incapacitated. 

It can be employed to keep the score of harmless intellectual challenges, 
as well as devastating psychic attack on the mental sanity of the characters.
