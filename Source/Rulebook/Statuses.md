# Statuses and status points

Characters will sustain negative effects in pools called *statuses*. Most statuses are binary,
i.e. on or off. For example, a character may be *asleep* or *awake*: its "being awake" status may
be on/off.

Some statuses have numeric values, and the character will be negatively affected if the number
increases. For example, the number of [injury points](#injury-points):
the higher, the worse.

Finally, there are statuses that start at a certain maximum level, and as the characters use 
their skills, they are used up. This statuses are called *pools*, and various modules and 
sub-systems can define different pools for specific usages. For example, a magic system may
define a *mana pool*, which determines how many spells a character can cast.
