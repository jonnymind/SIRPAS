## A system for everyone

Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran players.

Who reads this manual and has never heard about role playing games
before will encounter many new terms that have a special meaning in RPG,
as *session*, *adventure*, *campaign*, *world*, *setting*, *character*,
etc. Also, they might need on how to prepare, organize, manage, or
even behave during a session. This is important, but it is not covered
in this manual. This rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible;
all the concepts commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger
Internet. 

However, to help the beginners getting on RPG with Sirpas, depending on the
media youâ€™re reading the rulebook, we will:

1.	provide hyperlink to the description of the term. 
2.	highlighting terms with special meaning in RPG. A fast Internet search
   for "RPG" and the highlighted word will  bring you to the description of the term.
3.	Add a box named "For Beginners" near the relevant terms, that experienced
   readers can skip.
