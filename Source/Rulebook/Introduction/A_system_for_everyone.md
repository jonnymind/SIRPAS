## A system for everyone

Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran players.

However, this manual takes the basic concepts of RPGs for granted; 
it doesn't explain how to prepare, organize, manage, or behave during a 
game session. This rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible;
all the concepts commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger
Internet, and may be introduced in a different manual.
