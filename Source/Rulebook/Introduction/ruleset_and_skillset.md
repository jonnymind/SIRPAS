## Ruleset and Skillset

SIRPAS is based on a *ruleset* and one or more *skillsets*. Together, they 
describe how to use the *roleplaying mechanics*:
they explain how to perform a certain action, attack or defend in combat,
cast a magic spell and so on. 

A *skillset* is a set of numerical and qualitative attributes that describe
the abilities of a character. *Strength*, *dexterity*, *ancient knowledge*, 
*piloting vehicles* and so on would be some of the abilities defined by a
*skillset*.

The *ruleset* is unique, and describe how the elements of any skillset operate.
It describes how to use the content of any skillset in the SIRPAS system. 
For example, it describes how to check if a character is able to perform a certain
action, how to pick the winner in a contest based on certain skills, how to
undertake hostile actions (combat) and so on, how to deal with injuries 
without referencing a specific skillset. The rules described in the SIRPAS *ruleset*
apply to any situation, no matter the specific attribute used in that particular
context. 

For example, the injury rules apply to any character susceptible of being injured,
no matter if that character is a human, a mythological hero, an AI or a spaceship;
only the details of which specific form of injury, resistances, health level and so
on will change depending on the context, that is, on the *skillset* used.

This manual contains the *ruleset* and the *generic skillset*, which is a skillset
that can be employed directly in most situations without any modification.

## Generic Skillset

The *generic skillset* is a simple and generic set of attributes that fits
many different scenarios; from realistic historical settings to high-fantasy 
realms, from space operas to cyberpunk future cities. 

However, it assumes that the playing characters are either human or humanoids, and that
their feat are somewhat grounded in common human experiences. 
It may be not adequate to describe worlds where characters are completely different;
for example, body-less AIs, Chinese opera Wu-xia semi-gods, giant robots, starships etc. 
could  require a completely different skillset.

Some settings could leverage the *generic skillset* by just adding or altering a minimal
amount of elements. For example, a setting about a war between lycanthropes
and vampires may just add some skills, a main characteristic besides its *Body* and 
*Mind* values, and retune the maximum possible values to accommodate for super-human
bodies.

So, further skillsets may add to, integrate with or substitute the *generic skillset*
entirely.
