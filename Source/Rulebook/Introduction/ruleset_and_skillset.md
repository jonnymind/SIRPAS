## Ruleset and Skillset

SIRPAS is based on a *ruleset* and one or more *skillsets*. Together, they 
describe how to use the *roleplaying mechanics*: they explain how to perform 
certain action, attack or defend in combat, cast a magic spell and so on,
perform an athletic feat and so on.

A *skillset* is a set of numerical and qualitative attributes that describe
the abilities of a character. *Strength*, *dexterity*, *ancient knowledge*, 
*piloting vehicles* and so on would be some of the attributes defined by a
*skillset*.

The *ruleset* describes how any skillset in the SIRPAS system works.

This manual contains the *ruleset* and the *generic skillset*, which 
can be used in most scenarios and game worlds directly any modification.

To make this manual simpler to use, the **generic skillset** is presented together
with the parts of the *rulset* it refers to, in sections separated by the heading
"Generic Skillset". Despite being in the same manual, the *generic skillset* should
not be considered a mandatory part of the SIRPAS system: it's just a basic 
implementation, ready for use to start playing right away.

**Example**: the *ruleset* indicates that
characters participating in a fight need to perform a *ranking check* to determine
the order in which they can perform their action, but doesn't indicate which skill
is to be used for the ranking. The *generic skillset* defines an **Initiative** skill,
which is based on either **Dexterity** or **Will** attributes, that is used to perform 
the ranking. Another *skillset* may:

* redefine the **Initiative** skill to be based on different
characteristics: for example, it may be baseless or based on **Computational Speed** for AIs; or
* set up a different skill for the purpose; for example, in a western epic setting it
  may be **Gunslinging**.

### Limits of the Generic Skillset

The *generic skillset* should be directly applicable to 
many different scenarios; from realistic historical settings to high-fantasy 
realms, from space operas to cyberpunk future cities. However, it assumes that the
playing characters are either humans, and that their feat are somewhat grounded in common human 
experiences. It may be not adequate to describe worlds where characters are completely different;
for example, body-less AIs, Chinese opera Wu-xia semi-gods, giant robots, starships etc. 
could require a completely different skillset.

Some settings could leverage the *generic skillset* by just adding or altering some
aspects, while others may use a completely different set of skills. 
For example, a setting about a war between lycanthropes and vampires may be based
on the the generic skillset and:

* Add a primary attribute besides **Body** and **Mind**, i.e. **Darkness**.
* add some skills that only lycanthropes or vampires can have.
* tweak the maximum values beyond 18 to reflect super-human abilities.

On the other hand, a Cthulhu-eqsue adventure setting may ditch the concept of 
**Body** and **Mind** entirely, and just define a **Sanity** primary attribute.
