## Feel of the system

@(-- deprecated --)

Sirpas has the following characteristics:

- Generic: rules are meant to be applicable in any settings you can come up with. More on that later.
- Modular: Sirpas has a lean set of rules called **Base System**. The base system is generic enough
  to support any world setting and playing style. On this base system, additional rules (called **modules**)
  can be attached to better fit your game world. Want a system to perform mind fights between Asimov inspired psionic 
  super-humans? We got you. Want a be a gunslinger involved in western-styled show downs? That can be done too.
  A wizard casting magic spells? No problem. An occultist summoning extra-dimensional entities? That's fine.
  The system is even flexible enough to merge multiple styles of magic, melee combats, large scale fights
  and ranged missile firing in the same session. Yes, you can bring a bow (or a knife) in a gunfight.
- Extensible: Other than designing your own additional modules, you can also modify the base system to fit
  your need. For example, there base system has two main attributes called **Body** and **Mind**; if you
  want to play as an AI in a virtual world, you may replace **Body** with **MIPS** (millions of operation per second),
  and use **Mind** as an expression of the quality of your O.S. and software. The rest of the base system will
  still stand and be mostly useful for you to play with.
- Role-play oriented: the system emphasizes the build-up of the character; both the composition of its skill set
  in the adventure world, and the makeup of its personality, play a primary role in how the rules unfold.
- Simple as you want: the base system has differently detailed rules to resolve game situations. For example,
  combat or any type of confrontation between two opposing parties could be resolved with a single throw of a few dices ("Risk!" style), or with the detail of a Warhammer miniature replica battlefield.

All the system is based on multiple rolls of a standard dice with 6 faces; however, different modules support other kind of die, if that's the vibe you want for your game.
