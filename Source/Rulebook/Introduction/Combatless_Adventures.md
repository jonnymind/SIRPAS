## Combatless Adventures

In most RPG settings, combat is a central part of the game action, if not the
absolute protagonist. This leads to RPG systems being usually structured around
the combat mechanics, and gaming sessions being mainly occupied by detailing
combat actions.

Sirpas works the other way around: the combat system is simply the
specialization of the general system. As such, is possible to run adventures or
entire campaign devoid of "combat", and focusing either on other kind of contest
(as i.e. skill battles in virtual worlds), or in other aspects of the role
playing altogether.

Consider, for example, a police drama as a RPG setting. While gunfights might
play an important part in the campaign, the very nature of a gunfight doesnâ€™t
translate into interesting RPG mechanics, while more interesting actions as
sword fights or martial art fights might not fit the setting.

As such, Sirpas focuses on a more differentiated gameplay, which can be as
combat-intensive or combat-devoid as needed.
