## Play Any World

Sirpas is a generic role playing system, that doesnâ€™t presume anything on the
setting of your adventures. The system applies whatever your players might want
to play; as normal people struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, as
wizards and knights in a high fantasy setting, as cyborgs in a SF plot, or even
as AIs in a virtual reality.
