# Perks and Drags

Perks and drags are generic advantages and disadvantages that donâ€™t 
impact the game system directly. They usually give more flavor  in 
terms of roleplaying, and better define a character in its settings.

Being famous, of noble origins, being able to play a certain instrument, 
knowing a certain literature or scientific topic, being rich, and the 
inverse of those are considered perks (or drags). 
 
They can and usually will have an influence in how the adventure plays, 
and some of them can have indirect and direct effect on the rules.

For example, if a certain module has a **Criminal Boss** perk, that may
influence any attempt to **intimidate** specific characters that know 
about the reputation of the character, and have a reason to fear it.
