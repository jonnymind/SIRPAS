  "*Name": "Nimble crowder",
  "*Brief": "Can downgrade place in a ranking at will",
  "Category": "Advantage",
  "Specialization": "Skill", 
  "Cost": "1 TT/Hard",
  "Conflict": "Latecomer"
}

This advantage allows to exchange the place in a [ranking]($RulebookAddress#ranking) or
[multiranking]($RulebookAddress#multiranking) with any character from their party that scored
in a lower position in those rankings where being placed high
is advantageous, or raise in the ranking where higher places
are disadvantageous.

For example, supposed a [simplified combat]($RulebookAddress#simplified-combat)
is taking place, and these are the results:

| Place | Party A | Party B | Winner |
|------:|---------|---------|--------|
| 1     | 18      |  22     | B      |
| 2     | 16      |  18     | B      |
| 3     | 12      |  15     | B      |
| 4     | 9       |  8      | A      |

Party A scores 1 and party B scores 3 points, as party B wins the first three places, while 
party A wins the 4th.

If the character in second place uses the **nimble crowder** advantage to move down at the 3d rank,
now party A and B are in a draw: 18-22 (point B), 12-18 (point B), 16-14 (point A), 9-8 (point A).
With this move, the character that was previously in the second place can improve the tactical
outcome of the battle.

Another usage of this advantage may be during a [basic combat]($RulebookAddress#basic-combat) 
**combat order** ranking, which, in this *foundation*, is performed on the [initiative](#initiative) 
skill. Suppose the outcome of the ranking is as follows.

| Place | Roll    | Party   | Member |
|------:|---------|---------|--------|
| 1     | 18      |  A      | Warrior|
| 2     | 16      |  B      | Goblin |
| 3     | 12      |  A      | Wizard |
| 4     | 9       |  B      | Gnoll  |

If the warrior uses the placement to just wait for a better moment, the goblin
will go first; but they use this advantage to move to the third spot in place
of the wizard, that character can go first, and cast a debilitating spell on
the opposing party.

This advantage conflicts with the [latecomer](#latecomer) disadvantage.
