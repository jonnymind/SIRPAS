### Expertise

@(dd expertise)
{ 
  "*Name": "Expertise",
  "*Brief": "Throw 4 die and select 3 in any check",
  "Category": "Advantage",
  "Specialization": "Skill", 
  "Cost": "3 TT/Hard",
  "Prerequisite": "Easygoing"
}

This advantage allows to throw 4 die instead of 3 in any check
involving the specified skill, and select the three best rolls out
of them.

This includes combat styles and other combat skills.

The prerequisite for Expertise is to have [Easygoing](#easygoing) on the
same skill.

When targeted with this advantage, some skills also improve their
quality. For example, [first-aid](#BaM-s-first-aid) can normally
cure light wounds only, but if the character has the advantage
*Expertise/First-Aid*, it can also cure serious wounds.

Skills having a special effect when associated with Expertise will describe
it explicitly in their description.
