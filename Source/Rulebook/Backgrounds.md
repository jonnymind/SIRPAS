# Backgrounds

Backgrounds are generic advantages and disadvantages giving 
deeper customization to characters in the game world. 

Whatever in makes the character stand out with respect to the vast
population is considered a *background*.

Some backgrounds may be generally advantageous for the character,
while others might be generally detrimental. 

For example, being famous, of noble origins, 
having a career in a peculiar field as university professor,
being an outlaw, a member of an ostracized
religious sect or having an uncommon phobia are all *backgrounds*. 
While being famous seems more desirable than being an outlaw,
in some game situations it may be preferable to be the latter than
the former. 

For this reason, there isn't a net distinction between positive
and negative backgrounds, and they all have a positive cost in 
**training tokens** to be spent at character creation. It is also
possible to receive the backgrounds as a consequence of adventuring;
for example, one can certainly become an outlaw during the course 
of an adventure; nobles can lose their titles, university professors
can lose their positions and phobias can be cured, but differently from
*vantages*, *backgrounds* can only be removed as a consequence of
gameplay.
