# Introduction

SIRPAS stands for "SImple Role Playing Adventure System". It's a generic, modular
and extensible table-top RPG system, that aims to be as simple as needed and
become as complex as you wish.

SIRPAS is organized in the following components:

- The **rulebook** (what you're reading now): bare-bone description of how the
  system works. There isn't any list of skills, attributes, or specific 
  rendering of the rules in practice. At times we'll use some well known 
  skill that may be found in any generic RPG (e.g. *strength* or *climbing*) 
  to make some example of how the rules work, but nothing more.
- The **base module**: a basic implementation of the rules, which describes
  very generic attributes, skills, damage sources and other concrete aspect of the
  system, that should be general enough to be applied to most if not all the
  RPG settings you may come up with.
- Additional **modules**: Extension of the base system (which may enrich it or
  change it if necessary), particularly adequate to describe some specific world
  or setting for your adventures.

All you need is the **base module**. The system will often refer to the rules in this
rulebook, so you will need to know them, but you don't need to know them *upfront*. The
**base module** will briefly explain the relevant rules when possible or point at this
rulebook when necessary. You may wish to read this book in advance, skim over it, or
just ignore it until you feel the need to read some portions of it following the 
**base module**.

## What is SIRPAS?

SIRPAS is a "SImple Role Playing Adventure System".

So, we’re talking *adventures* here: a role playing session that can spawn for 
a casual night with friends, or with the family, or with strangers met at a gaming 
club. Systems thought for Role Playing Games are (usually) complex enough for you 
to invest lots of time in creating your characters, play through multiple sessions 
and use some time off to sort your past games out to get fun out of them. 

Some may say that's actually part of the fun itself. If you like the streamlined 
experience of Sirpas gameplay, you can play adventures spawning multiple sessions, 
or multiple adventures with the same characters, in the same world (this is often
referred as *campaign*). 

But you don’t need to. The idea is having as little commitment as necessary to get 
playing, and then, pour in as much commitment as you want if you like it.
