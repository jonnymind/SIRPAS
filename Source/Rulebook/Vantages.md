# Vantages

**Vantages** special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific attribute 
or set of attribute in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.
They are called **advantages** if positive and **disadvantages** if negative. 

For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to automatically win a draw once a day. 
Others may give you extra die to throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra
point to all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all *easy skill checks* based on 
a certain attribute. Others may reduce the difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one
level, so that i.e. a skill called **climbing** on *easy* targets becomes trivial, on *normal* targets it 
becomes *easy* and so on. 

**Disadvantages** are negative **vantages**. A character might be given
disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during
previous adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages have negative CP costs, 
a player can chose to get certain disadvantages in order to gain **training tokens** to be
spent elsewhere, in other statistics.

While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have different levels. 
For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level
of all survival checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra reduced difficulty level. 

In that case, the cost to be paid (or refund obtained) of each level is the base cost 
plus the level acquired.

For example, suppose an advantage called **graceful** can be acquired at levels 1 to 3, each level
making the advantage stronger. 
The cost indicated in the description is 2 **TT**/*Primary* (training tokens of type *primary*). 
To buy level 1, the players must spend 2 + 1 = 3 tokens; level 2 costs 2 + 2 = 4, and level 3
2 + 3 = 5 tokens. This means that if players wants to get **graceful**/3 from scratch, 
they must use 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 *primary* tokens.

The tokens refunded when acquiring (willfully) a disadvantage follow the same rule, granting
a number of tokens equal to the indicated base cost plus the level the players are willing
to take, cumulated. So, if a disadvantage called **clumsy** has base "cost" 2 **TT**/*Primary* and
can be acquired with level 1 to 3, players giving **clumsy**/3 to their character will receive
3 + 4 + 5 = 12 **TT**/*Primary* to be spent on something else.
