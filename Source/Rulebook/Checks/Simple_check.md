## Simple check

A *simple check* is a test for the character to be able to perform a certain
action, which requires a certain **skill** to be employed. For example, to verify 
if the character can land safely after jumping down from a height, it must pass 
a *simple check* on a skill having that purpose (for example *acrobatics*).

The skill descriptions indicate which actions are covered by each of them. When a character 
wants to perform an action not covered by a specific skill, one of its generic attributes are used instead; 
the Game Master decide which is the most adequate one. For example, if a character is trying to 
extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, 
the Game Master might ask to pass a *simple check* on its *strength*.

To *perform* a **simple check** means to throw three dice (or a different number, where the
rules specify it) and sum the result of the rolled dice to the value of the employed skill or
attribute. The rules might specify other modifiers to be applied to specific checks; for example
being injured applies a penalty to any check.

The sole result of the dice rolls is called **natural result**, while the grand total of the **natural result**,
skill or attribute value and modifiers is called *check result* (**CR**). To win (or *pass*) a **simple check**, 
the **check result** must be above a score called *success level* (**SL**) that depends on the difficulty of 
the action, according with the following table:

@(include /tables/difficulty.md)

Skill descriptions will reference this table to specify which kind off attempt are to considered, easy,
normal, hard and so on. When the skill description doesn't specify it,
the Game Master can assign a difficulty modifier depending on the situation.

Some skills may be performed only against a **normal** success level, but assign an additional
bonus or penalty depending on the situation. For example, trying to perform an acrobatic action
while jumping from high may inflict a penalty that increases in proportion to the height of the jump.

### Success Margin

The difference between the **check result** and the **success level** is called **Success Margin** 
(**SM**). The **SM** is 0 or above on success, and less than 0 on failure.

### Automatic Results

In a **simple check**, When a *natural 18* is scored, and if the action is of *normal* difficulty 
or easier, the *simple check* is automatically passed, regardless the *check result* being actually 
above the required **SL** or not.

When a *natural 3* is scored, and if the action is of *normal* difficulty or harder, the *simple check*
automatically fails, regardless the *check result* being actually below the required **SL** or not.

**Optional:** *easy* actions have an *automatic success* with a *natural 17* or better and *very easy*
actions with a *natural 16* or better. *Hard* actions fail automatically with a *natural 4* or worse, and
*very hard* actions with a *natural 5* or worse.

An **automatic result** is considered also a **critical success** or **critical failure**.
