## Critical Results

[Automatic results](#RB-automatic-results) in simple checks are considered
critical results, but a critical result can also be achieved when the
success margin of an action is extreme (in both directions).

Unless specified otherwise, a *success margin* particularly high is
called *critical success* (**CrS**), and one particularly low is called 
*critical failure* (**CrF**).
 
Critical successes and failures will
result in particularly good or bad outcomes; when not specified by 
the rules or the skill description, the Game Master will determine 
how the outcome exceeds a normal result. 

In a *contest* a *critical success* can be 
scored only by the winning party (as the **SM** can be only positive, and
is assigned to the winner); hence, a contest can't determine **critical failures**.

Conversely, **rankings** have only negative **SM**, so they cannot result in 
**critical successes**.

The following table describes which **SM** are considered **critical results**,
depending on the complexity of the action. *Contests* are considered *normal actions*
on this regard, unless specified otherwise.
