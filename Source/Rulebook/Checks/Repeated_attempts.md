## Repeated Attempts {#RB-repeated-attempts}

In some situation, it is possible to repeat a failed attempt soon after the
first try, either by the same character or by another one in the same group.
 
For example, picking a lock (when no one is around and there arenâ€™t
time constraints) can be repeated indefinitely by every member that could be 
able to open it, until a success is achieved, or unless the lock turns out
to be actually impossible to pick.

Normally, any check that can rationally be performed more than once in a row can
be repeated by increasing the **SL** by 2 points. For example, suppose you're retrying 
to break in an apartment; you have to perform a check on a lockpick skill
against a **SL** of 21 (a normal check). On failure, your character or another one in the group
might try again, but this time the **SL** will be 23.

The time required for an attempt is usually indicated in the description of the target
skill; if not, the Game Master decides how long any attempt should take, depending on 
the situation.

It is possible to attempt the action again with its natural **SL** letting a reasonable
amount of time to pass. For actions taking a few moments, it will be after a long rest
(equivalent of a good night of sleep). For actions requiring long preparation (i.e. 
studying the lore of a region), it might be a week or a month; if not specified in the
skill description, the Game Master will decide.
