## Rankings

Ranking rolls (**RNK**) are special contests between two or more characters, ranking them in a
order that doesnâ€™t allow for draws. Also, in *rankings* the **SM** is not relevant.

For example, to establish the arrival order in a running relay, every participant rolls a ranking on 
a skill used for running.  The order of arrival is decided once and for all, 
and draws are not allowed.

Draws are resolved by re-rolling on the same skill. The re-roll is only relevant
for the relative order of the characters in draw. For example, suppose that, in
said race, four character score a total of 26, 22, 22 and 20 respectively. Now,
the second and third characters roll to decide their relative position; the winner
of the two will be the second in ranking, and the looser will be the third, regardless
of the score they draw now.
