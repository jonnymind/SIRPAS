## Effect on the game

Backgrounds can and usually will have an influence in how the adventure plays,
but they don't have a direct effect on the rules; that what's
vantages are for. However, some of them may have
some indirect effect on the rules in some specific situation. 

For example, being a **criminal boss** doesn't give the character a direct upgrade
or downgrade in any skill check; it is meant to direct the character's adventure 
in a certain direction, and make clearer how they will react when facing
criminality or law enforcement, but in some cases the **GM** may apply a
discretional bonus or penalty on some check, i.e. when trying to
**intimidate** a gang member.

## Backgrounds are not physical

Physical characteristics are never to be considered backgrounds; this
because any physically apparent characteristic would either have an
effect on attributes or be severely limiting on the gameplay. For example,
the ability to **persuade** already takes into account the attractiveness
of a character. Conversely, a physical disability is difficult to translate
into gameplay, while a low attribute number can better represent it.
