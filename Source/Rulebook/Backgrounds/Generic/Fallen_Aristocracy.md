  "*Name": "Fallen Aristocrat",
  "*Short": "Chr. was part of former or banned aristocracy",
  "Category": "Background",
  "Cost": "1+ TT/Hard"
}

The character was part of an aristocratic family in the target setting, 
but either:

* they are prevented from accessing the benefits of that position; or
* they lost permanently or semi-permanently that position.
  
Some possible examples:

* an out-of-wedlock child of a baron, who is known by their
  father but not officially recognized as a heir; 
* the only child survivor of a usurped and exterminated royal family;
* a former party leader that has been excised out of the ruling structures
  during some power struggle.
* A noble rebelling against their king.

A character like Robin Hood would fit this background.

The cost, and the effect of the background on the game, depends on the
level of former / unrecognized aristocracy:

* Baron, career politician, oligarch: 1 TT/Hard 
* Count, party leader, organization leader: 2 TT/Hard
* Duke, minister, CEO: 3 TT/Hard
* King, prince, prime minister, president: 4 TT/Hard
