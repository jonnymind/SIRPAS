## Famous 

@(dd famous)
{
  "*Name": "Famous",
  "*Short": "Character is well known by the population",
  "Category": "Background",
  "Cost": "1+ TT/Primary"
}

The character is famous and easily identified by its peers.
Also, whoever wants to know about the character, or searching
for it because of any specific reason (i.e. to hire it for
a job, or to hunt it down), can easily find information
about it and its general whereabouts, unless the character
actively disguises and hides.

Characters with other backgrounds may be famous as well;
an aristocrat probably is, and so is a boss criminal. This
background covers being famous directly for
some deed or action, besides the ones specifically covered by
other backgrounds.

The cost depends on how famous the character is:

* 1 **TT**/*Primary*: Known by 1/20th-1/10th of the population; people
  occasionally identify them when walking by, and have
  heard of he character.
* 2 **TT**/*Primary*: Known by 1/5th of the population. During a day out,
  or a long walk, the character is sure to be recognized,
  and possibly stopped by admirers (or haters).
* 3 **TT**/*Primary*: Known by more than half the population. Wherever the
  character goes, they are recognized, and when that happens,
  people flock to see them, or flee if they have a negative fame.
