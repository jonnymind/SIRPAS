### Most specific attribute

As attributes are ordered in a hierarchy, the base of each of them indicating their parent,
when a character needs to perform an action for which a specific attribute is not provided
by the game module in use, the Game Master will chose the best approximation possible.

Example: Suppose the game module provides the attributes **charisma**, base for **elegance**,
which is base for **etiquette**. If the character needs to perform a correct ballroom 
introduction, **etiquette** will be chosen; to determine how well they dance (provided 
there isn't a **dance** skill available), **elegance** will be next in the line, and
to determine the impression left with some chit-chat after the dance, **charisma** will be
used.
