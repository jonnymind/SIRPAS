### Base Modifiers

In some situation, instead of using an attribute as a direct base, 
the system requires to use a *modifier* that depends on the value
of the base. Those are called **base modifiers**.

This happens when some attributes are hard to train, and so
they need to be learned almost from scratch, but some other
attribute may give a minor advantage. For example learning
**lores** requires studying them; there is no way around actually
opening the books (or any equivalent media). However, a high
**intelligence** may help both to memorize and grasp some aspect or
detail that would pass unnoticed by most. In such cases, the
**intelligence** cannot be a direct base for **lores**, but could
well provide a base modifier.

The following table indicates the **base modifier** associated with
the value of the base attribute. 

$(include /tables/modifiers.md)

To indicate that the modifier of an attribute is base for another, the
attribute is prefixed with a lower case "**m**". For example, 
Suppose a skill like **swimming** is based on the modifier of an
attribute called **Dex**. The base of **swimming** will be then
expressed not as **Dex**, but as m**Dex**.
