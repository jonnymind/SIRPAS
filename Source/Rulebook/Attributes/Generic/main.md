## Generic Attributes

The *Generic Skillset* provides a set of primary and secondary 
attributes that can be used in most settings, together with some
generic skills that cover most common situations.

Every character has the following *primary* and *secondary* attributes:

* Body (**B**): The physical aspect of the character. Body *secondary* attributes are:
  * Strength (**S**): raw physical power;
  * Dexterity (**D**): speed, precision and control over actions performed with the body;
  * Health (**H**): Resilience against fatigue, injury and illness.
* Mind (**M**): describes the mental prowess of a character. Mind *secondary* attributes are:
  * Will (**W**): strength of conviction and assertiveness.  
  * Intelligence (**I**): ability to understand and solve complex problems; mental flexibility.
  * Equilibrium (**E**): resilience to mental strain, stress and madness.

The [**body**](#body) primary provides also the **base value** of 
[**strength**](#strength), [**dexterity**](#dexterity) and (**health**)[#health]. This means that
the value of **body** is also the *default* value for the these dependent primaries; you can
then train each of them separately using *scondary tokens*, and improve them over their base
value, but if you train the main trait **body**, all its dependent attributes will grow with it.

Similarly, [**mind**](#mind) provides the base value for [**will**](#will), [**intelligence**](#intelligence) and [**equilibrium**](#equilibrium).

In turn, the secondary attributes are themselves base for other attributes and skills.
