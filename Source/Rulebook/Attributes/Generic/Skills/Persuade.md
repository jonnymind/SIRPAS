With this skill, the character can persuade others. Persuading means leading
others to believe the truth of some idea, fact or point of view (regardless of
them being actually true or not). Persuasion works on characters that don’t have
strong evidence or didn’t made up their mind already on said idea, fact or point
of view.

Persuasion can also be used to convince someone into performing some action, or
abstaining to perform some action they should do, provided the consequences for
doing so are not particularly harsh. For example, you can persuade some security
guards to let you in a restricted party, provided they don’t have categorical
orders, or provided that they think they can get away with a transgression.
