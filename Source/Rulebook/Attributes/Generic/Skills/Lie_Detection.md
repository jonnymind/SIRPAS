### Lie Detection

  "*Name": "Lie Detection",
  "*Brief": "Reliably detects if a target is lying",

  "Callsign": "LD",
  "Category": "Skill",
  "Cost": "1 TT/Hard"
}

This skill represents the ability of the character to detect lies, given
small hints on the voice, facial expressions and behavior of the target.

A skilled lier can oppose its deception; in this case, there will be a
simple contest (**CNT**) between the [persuade](#persuade) skill of the target
against the **LD** of the character. 

If the target isn't an able deceiver, the character can try
a check on this skill, with a difficulty that depends on the amount of
information the character has about the truth.
