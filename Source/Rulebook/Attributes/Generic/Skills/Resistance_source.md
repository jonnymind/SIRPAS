}

The character has acquired a specific resistance against
a determined damage source. The base of the resistance
depends on the macro-category of the damage source,
as specified in the following table:

| Damage type | Base        |
|-------------|-------------|
| Physical    | Health      |
| Mental      | Equilibrium |
| Elemental   | Elem. Res.  |

The advantage [Elemental Resistance](#elemental-resitance) gives
the base against elemental damage.

This skill is used in **Resistance Checks** (**RC**) to avoid negative
effects from various deadly or potentially incapacitating sources.
Poisons, illness, certain magic spells, overwhelming mental attacks
and so on.

This is not a combat skill, but it may be used in specific situation
also in combat; for example, it's used to avert complete incapacitation
after receiving a deadly wound.
