The character has advanced practical medical knowledge for the setting
where the adventure takes place, and is able to heal wounds of the target
creature race. 

The following table is applied when checking for the character success:

@(include /tables/treating_wounds.md)

Standard First-aid kits give a +6 modifier to heal *light wounds* only. 
Specific healing aids in the target setting can provide other modifiers.

The time required for the healing to be performed depends on the setting
and on the device used. A SF cellular replicator or a magic balm could
allow healing heavy wounds in one day, in a few hours or in minutes,
while in other settings, an herbal healing remedy might require a week.

The *race type* specifier is to be considered in large categories. For
example:
* Humanoids (Humans, elves, orcs etc.)
* Human-sized animals (dogs to deers)
* Small animals (birds, cats, etc.)
* Large animals (elephant, dragons, etc.)
