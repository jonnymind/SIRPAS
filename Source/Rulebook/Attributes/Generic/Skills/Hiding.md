### Hiding

}

The character knows how to hide so to look like inconspicuous material
(i.e. a sack of potatoes, a part of a load of straw on a cart, a roll
of cloth and so on). The difficulty of the check is determined by the GM.

This skill is used only when trying to hide into a spot or a location
that offer a high chance not to be seen at all. To try and hide in 
places or behind covers that would offer little screening from sight,
use [Hiding in Shadows](#hiding-in-shadows) instead.
