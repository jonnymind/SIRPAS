### Dexterity

Dexterity (**D**) expresses the ability to control oneâ€™s own body.
Eye-hand coordination, agility, reaction times and rapidity are all 
components of dexterity. A dexterity of 3 indicates sluggish reaction times, 
18 indicates a martial-art or olympic gymnast level of dexterity, 
with the vast majority of common people stacking around 10-12.

The *dexterity* indicates also the base movement speed of a character.
The actual speed depends on what a character actually is; a cyborg with
**D**12 will probably be faster than any human with **D**18. 

The following table is for humans; you can adapt it to other races
by using the *speed coefficient* of that race (for humans, it's 1).

Notice that the speed for combat turn is not necessarily the sprint speed,
as movement during combat is limited by other factors. Also, the combat
turn here is the standard 10 seconds combat turn of the the base system;
other systems might redefine the duration of a combat turn (and how *dexterity*
works in those contexts).
