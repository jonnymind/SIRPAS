Health (**H**) represents the resistance to fatigue, illness and polluted 
environment (including allergenic agents). It's used to determine how many
injuries can be withstood before being incapacitated, and gives the base for 
all physical resistance skills.

A normal character can sustain 10 + **H** **IP**s from physical sources before 
becoming *incapacitated* and risk dying without an active intervention (e.g.
having someone using the [stabilize](#stabilize) skill on them).

Also, characters can ignore the **IP** penalty up to **mH**. For example,
a character with *health* 17 (**mH** = 3) can ignore the first 3 penalties
(at **IP** 6). If the character receives 16 **IP**s, it will suffer 
(16-6)/2 = 5 points of penalty.
