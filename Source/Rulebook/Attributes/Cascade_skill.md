### Cascade Skills

*Cascade skills* are skills that require a check on a different subversion of the
skill each time a check is repeatedly attempted. 

For example, some combat skills can be used only once per combat turn. To use them
multiple times in a turn, a second version of the same skill must be trained.

In the player sheet, they will be indicated as "Cascade skill / 1", "Cascade Skill / 2"
and so on. If the composite skill is specialized, it will be indicated as 
"Cascade Skill/specialization / 1", "Cascade Skill/specialization / 2" and so on.

Composite attributes are still targeted as a single one by attribute-targeting advantages
and disadvantages.

For example, if "Active Mitigation" is a combat cascade and specialized skill,
and **Swordfight** is a combat style,
the advantage **Expert / Active Mitigation / Swordfight** will cover all the versions
of **Active Mitigation / Swordfight**.
