### Cascade Attributes

Cascade attributes are attributes that can be be trained multiple times, each of them
representing a single attempt in repeated checks.

For example, some combat skills can be used only once per combat turn. To use them
multiple times in a turn, a second version of the same skill must be trained.

In the player sheet, they will be indicated as "Composite skill / 1", "Composite Skill / 2"
and so on. If the composite skill is specialized, it will be indicated as 
"Skill/specialization / 1", "Skill/specialization / 2" and so on.

Composite attributes are still targeted as a single one by attribute-targeting advantages
and disadvantages.

For example, if "Active Mitigation" is a combat specialized and composite attribute,
and **Swordfight** is a combat style,
the advantage **Expert / Active Mitigation / Swordfight** will cover all the versions
of **Active Mitigation / Swordfight**.
