# Skills

Skills are abilities that a character can exercise at a certain moment, and 
They are usually based on a single attribute; this means that, if the character
didn’t invent any CP in them, they assume the same value of he attribute they
are based on.

Some are based on multiple attributes: their base value can be a mean of two or 
more attributes, or can be the best out of alternative attributes.

Some skills don’t have a base: they represent abilities that must be learned
from scratch; for example lock picking must be learned before being used. Others 
have a base that depends on a base modifier; this is indicated
with a lowercase letter 'm' in front of the attribute.

Some skill require a using a certain [equipment]($RulebookAddress#equipment); non-standard
equipment may provide advantages or penalties of various nature to performing some
action. When relevant, the type of equipment required to use a certain skill is specified under the 
**EC** (equipment category) entry; optional equipment is marked as **opt**.
