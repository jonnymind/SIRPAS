## Character power

At times it's useful to have a rough estimate of the approximate power of a character. That
can be useful to determine at a glance if a certain adventure is too hard or too easy for
the players, or to decide how many enemies of a certain type it's fair to face in a fight.

How strong is a character is a matter of how the various skills have been trained. For this
reason, the **power** of a character is determined as the number of **main** training tokens
needed train all its skills, rounded up. 

To determine this value sum all the points spent on every skill and attribute, dividing them
accordingly with their relative hierarchy value.

- Mains: 1
- Primary: 1/2
- Secondary & Hard skills: 1/4
- Normal Skills: 1/8
- Easy Skills: 1/16

For example, a character has the following **mains** (notice that the base of all mains is 3):

- Body (3): 3 + 7 = 10  
- Mind (3): 3 + 6 = 9

These are the character primaries (again, we count the additional tokens spent on each attribute):

- Strength (**B**): 10 + 1 = 11
- Dexterity (**B**): 10 + 6 = 16
- Health (**B**): 10: 10 + 0 = 10
- Will (**M**): 9 + 3 = 12
- Intelligence (**M**): 9 + 5 = 14
- Equilibrium (**M**): 9 + 1 = 10

Then, the character has the following hard skills (baseless):

- Endurance: 5
- Engineering: 2

And the following normal skills:

- Deceit(**I**): 14 + 3 = 17
- Acrobatics(**D**): 16 + 1 = 17

The power is then:

* Points from the mains: 7 + 6 = 13
* Points from the primaries: (1 + 6 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 16) / 2 = 8
* Points from the hard skills: (5 + 2 = 7) / 4 = 1.75
* Points from the normal skills: (3 + 1 = 4) / 8 = 0.5

For a grand total of 13 + 8 + 1.75 + 0.5 = 23.25, rounded up to 24.

> It may be useful to note down the number of tokens actually spent
rather than recompute the power of the characters each time it's needed,
keeping track of the character power as it grows.
