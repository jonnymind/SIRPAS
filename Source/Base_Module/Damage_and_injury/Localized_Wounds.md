## Localized Wounds {BaM-m-localized-wounds}

By default, wounds are generally directed in the generic direction of the body,
but some abilities allow to aim a certain specific part of the body.

When a wound is localized on a specific body part (an arm, a leg), 
any action involving that body part receives the double amount of
penalty from that wound type. For instance, a *heavy wound* localized
on a leg will cause every action to receive a penalty of -2 points, 
but the penalty will be -4 on *running*, *jumping*, and anything specifically
involving that body part. 

This extends to non human and even virtual body parts as well: and AI receiving
a heavy wound on a virtual device will have a double penalty if it tries to use
that device to perform any action.

A wound localized on the head adds an extra penalty point on every action. 
Specifically, a light wound on the head will cause a penalty of -1, a serious
wound a penalty of -2, and a heavy wound a penalty of -3 on every action
performed by the character. Again, this extends to non human body parts too:
and AI hit on its virtual core will follow the same rule.
