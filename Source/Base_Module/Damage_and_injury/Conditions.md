## Conditions and Status

_Conditions_ are "standardized" negative effects that a particular
damage source can add, other than causing a direct damage.

When a condition is applied to a character for a prolonged time, it becomes a
__status__.

* *Wound*: A success causes an immediate wound â€” the seriousness of the wound
  being described here or in the skill description.
* *Block*: the target is grappled or anyhow blocked. The description of the
  skill will specified whether the attacker is blocked too.
* *Stun X*: the target is stun for a count X of turns, giving it a modifier
  of -2 to any action.
* *Fall*: The target falls on the ground, and is "grounded" for the next turn.
* *Disarm*: The target loses its weapon.
* *Cripple*: A limb of the target is crippled and becomes impaired. All
  actions requiring that limb receives a -4 modifier. If the crippled
  limb is a leg, 4-legged animals reduce their movement to half, bipedal
  animals (including human) to 1/4.
