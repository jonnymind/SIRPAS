## Disabled Status {#BaM-m-disabled-status}

When the number of *injury points* received exceeds the *injury resistance*,
the character becomes *disabled*, and might die if not treated.

The following table specifies what happens when the character receives an injury
that puts it down down for the count:

@(include tables/disable_status.md)

A heavy wound could be deadly, if it's received when the character was 1 **IP** away
from its limit, and it will die fast (within 10 minutes) if it was exactly at its
limit.

A character remains disabled until enough wounds are treated to bring its **IP** goes
below its **IR**. The skill [stabilize](#BaM-s-stabilize) and [first aid](#BaM-s-first-aid) 
can be employed to avert death in case the **IP** passed **IR** by more than 3 points.
