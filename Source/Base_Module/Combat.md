# Combat

Combat is an advanced form of contest. In a normal contest, characters
try to win one over another on specific skills, while in combat,
contests are finalized to deal damage or other negative effects on
an unwilling target.

The Rule Book provides several sub-systems to resolve conflicts, increasingly
detailed (and complex):

* *Simplified Combat*: It's a simple way to resolve small combats.
	It consists in a specialized form of [multi-contest](#multi-contest) applied to combat
	skills, which takes into account the relative ranking in the contests to
	determine winners, losers, and other possible outcomes.
* *Basic Combat*: It's a sub-system dedicated specifically to combat, using
	the combat skills with specific rules, and takes into account positioning,
	tactical advantages and other combat-specific elements.
* *Advanced Combat*: This is the full fledged combat system, extending the
 	_basic combat_ and using special sub-skills called _maneuvers_.

You can mix and match these sub-systems in the same adventure, without
limitation. You can either choose one or another depending on the experience
of the players, or their inclinations, or you can base the choice on the
relevance of the combat in the adventure. For example, you could resolve
a brawl erupted in a tavern as a *simplified combat*, to turn to the
*advanced combat* when things get nasty while fighting the guards to escape
a dungeon.

## Advanced Combat Resources

Special maneuvers that can be performed in the advanced combat system have a
cost in either **Stamina** (**Stm**) or **Focus** (**Fcs**), depending on them
being based on either **Body** or **Mind**.

Characters have an initial pool of **Stamina** equal to the value of their **Body**,
and **Focus** equal to the value of their **Mind**; Vantages can increase or reduce
them, and other effects (sickness, curses, magic etc.) can temporarily change their 
value.

A character can perform a certain maneuver only if they have enough resources, which
are then consumed, until the pool hits zero. After that, only maneuvers with a cost of 0
can be performed.

The pool is replenished at the end of the combat, after a period of rest that of one
minute for each point to be replenished, rounded up to the nearest ten minute slot.

Consider, for example, a team with two characters that have lost 6 points of **Stamina** and
12 points of **Focus** respectively. The party will need a rest of 20 minutes in order
to fully replenish their pool.
