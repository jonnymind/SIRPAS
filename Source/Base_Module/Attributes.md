# Foundational Attributes

The *Foundation* has a hierarchy of attributes, from the least specific to the
more detailed. Attributes meant to express the proficiency of a character in
a particular ability are called *skills*, but are otherwise identical to other
attributes.

The hierarchy is so defined:

```
Mains -> Primary -> Secondary & Hard Skills -> Normal Skills -> Easy Skills
```

**Mains** and **Primaries** have a value between 3 and 18. 

For those, 3 means the attribute is minimally
functional, as that of a young child, and 18 is the peak achievement of a character
in the adventure setting. The vast majority of the population would stack
around 9-11.

Secondary attributes and skills have different value range: 0-20, with 0 being
*untrained* and 20 being the peak training possible.
