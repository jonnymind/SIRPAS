Strength (**S**) is the attribute measuring a character physical strength. 
In the default setting, it also indicates how much weight the character 
can transport without being fatigued, or the amount of weight it can 
carry without being slowed down, or that it can lift. There are different
tiers  used in various occasion, all multiple of the value of Strength in 
pounds:

@(include /tables/strength.md)

The name of the tiers match the names of the skill difficulty levels, 
as they are directly applied as a difficulty level in various checks.
However, they also define other effects that are not directly related with skills; 
for example, the transport weight tier is applied directly to the combat movement: 
a character transporting  a "very hard" weight has its movement cut to one third 
of it normal movement
