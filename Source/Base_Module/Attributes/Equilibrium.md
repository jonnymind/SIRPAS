Equilibrium (**E**) is the stability of the mind, 
or basically the equivalent of its health (**H**). It indicates 
how much mental strain a person can take before being debilitated; 
of course, it is important in those settings where attacks are delivered 
to the mind instead of the body: fantasy, sci-fi and horror settings 
can present as many dangers for the mind as for the body, or more.

Hence, it forms the base of all the mental resistance skills.
