Equilibrium (**E**) is the stability of the mind, 
or basically the equivalent of its health (**H**). It indicates 
how much mental strain a person can take before being debilitated; 
of course, it is important in those settings where attacks are delivered 
to the mind instead of the body: fantasy, sci-fi and horror settings 
can present as many dangers for the mind as for the body, or more.

Hence, it forms the base of all the mental resistance skills.

A normal character can sustain 10 + **E** **IP**s from psychic sources before 
becoming *incapacitated* and risk dying without an active intervention (e.g.
having someone using the [stabilize](#stabilize) skill on them).

Also, characters can ignore the **IP** penalty up to **mE**. For example,
a character with *euqilibrium* 17 (**mE** = 3) can ignore the first 3 penalties
(at **IP** 6). If the character receives 16 **IP**s, it will suffer 
(16-6)/2 = 5 points of penalty.
