The Body (**B**) is a value that describes your overall physical prowess in terms of
bodily strength, resilience to prolonged efforts, recovery speed, resistance to
illness and so on. For humans, it is measured in the range between 3 and 18 (the
possible outcomes of 3d6). Most adult characters score in the range between 9
and 12, with 18 representing a person with the best possible body (rarely if
ever ill, strong as the strongest wrestler or weight lifter, moving as swift as
a record runner and able to run as long as a marathon champion â€” all at the same
time), and 3 representing the weakest possible fully formed and barely
functional body.
