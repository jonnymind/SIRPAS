### Aim {#BaM-s-firearms-aim}

@(dd cm_firearm_aimed_shot)
{ "Type": "Action",
	"Prereq": "Firearms 3"
}

Take a maneuver to improve the next attack, giving it a
modifier of +1. It can be repeated any number of times within a 
single turn, but the modifier is applied only to the very next 
Shoot or Aimed Shoot, either within the same turn or in the very next one. 

No other action can be performed while aiming, and performing another
action will discard the modifiers achieved.
