### Overload {#BaM-s-archery-overload}

@(dd cm_archery_overload)
{ "Type": "Action",
	"Prereq": "Archery 9"
}

Loads two arrows or two bolts in the weapon. The very next attack will have a
fixed modifier of -3, but the character gains an extra attack
to be used in the current or the next turn.

> This maneuver gains an extra attack only. Defense and action count
is not affected.

This is useful when it’s not currently possible or ideal to attack a target, but
you don’t want to lose the attack.
