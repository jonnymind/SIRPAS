This attack consists in throwing a heavy object to an enemy in range.
Anything goes; even weapons, as long as the weight of the object is
between two and eight pounds weight.

The damage dealt is normally of __blunt__ type, unless the thrown object
is sharp; then it becomes of __cut__ type.

A critical success applies also the stun condition for 2 turns.
