	"Damage": "__SM__-1",
	"Condition": "__(Stun 2)__"
}

A counter-attack performed on melee attacks. Tries
to evade the incoming blow and use the opening to strike
with a punch on the higher part of the body. Has modifier -2 against
smaller creatures (itâ€™s harder to find a spot to counter-attack
them with a punch).

Ineffective against non-melee and animal attacks.
