## Natural

@(dd natural)
{ 
  "*Name": "Natural",
  "*Brief": "Reduce difficult, hard and very hard penalties",
  "Category": "Advantage",
  "Specialization": "Skill", 
  "Cost": "2 TT/Hard",
  "Prerequisite": "Easygoing"
}

The character is a "natural" in a certain discipline: tasks that would
be normally hard for anyone else come much easier to them. 

Difficult checks on the target skill get an additional modifier of +1, 
hard checks have an additional modifier of +2, and Very Hard 
checks have a +3 modifier. Without any other situational modifiers,
the effective modifiers for difficult, hard and very hard checks 
become -2, -4 and -5.

This advantage can target also combat styles and other combat skills.

Before becoming "natural" in a certain discipline, the character must
have acquired the advantage [easygoing](#easygoing) on the same discipline.
