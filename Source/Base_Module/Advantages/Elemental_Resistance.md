}

The character has an innate resistance to elemental attacks of the
specified type. All checks against the element type receive the
level of this advantage as a positive modifier. This includes
defense checks in combat and resistance checks.

This advantage should be granted only in settings where it
makes sense, i.e. as a racial characteristic of a fantasy
race, or for characters genetically engineered, or for
synthetic life forms as androids etc.
