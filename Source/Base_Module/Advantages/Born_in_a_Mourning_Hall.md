}

The character can withstand an additional heavy wound from mental sources 
(or the equivalent amount of **IP** from lighter wounds) before being
incapacitated, and will not die in case the last wound received was from a
mental source if not treated for 1 hour, regardless of the Injury Points
sustained.

The last mental wound received during a fight will automatically heal in 4
hours, even if not treated.
