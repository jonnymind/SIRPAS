  "*Name": "By the skins of one teeth",
  "*Brief": "Avert deadly wounds completely once per day",
  "Category": "Advantage",
  "Cost": "1 TT/Primary"
}

This advantage allows to resist automatically a single
deadly wound from any source once per day.

The "boundary" of the day is selected by the GM (on player's suggestion),
to be of some significance for the character. It could be the midnight
in a specific place, the sunset, the sunrise, or performing a 
daily ritual specific of the character's creed or habit.
