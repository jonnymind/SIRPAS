Ignore the negative modifier caused by wounds up to the level of this advantage
(maximum 3).

For example, if a character with **combative spirit** 1 receives a serious wound,
it would normally have a penalty of -1 to any check, but with this advantages
the penalty can be ignored. If another serious wound is received, instead of
the normal -2 penalty, the character will only receive a -1 penalty.
