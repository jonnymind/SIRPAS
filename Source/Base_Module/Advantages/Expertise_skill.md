## Expertise/skill (6CP) {#BaM-a-expertise}

Skill Expertise (SE) it’s an advantage bought for specific skills.

In every check performed on the target skill, the player can
throw 4d6 instead of 3d6, and discard the lower die.

When targeted with this advantage, some skills also improve their
quality. For example, [first-aid](#BaM-s-first-aid) can normally
cure light wounds only, but if the character has the advantage
*Expertise/First-Aid*, it can also cure serious wounds.

Skills having a special effect when associated with Expertise will describe
it explicitly in their description.
