  "*Brief": "Reroll once any dice scoring 1",
  "Category": "Advantage",
  "Cost": "1 TT/Main",
  "Conflict": "Unlucky"
}

The character can re-roll one dice having scored 1 on any check. This is applied 
before any other advantage is considered.

For example: a character with **expert**/*lockpicking* attempts opening a lock.
As they have the advantage [expert](#expert) on lock-picking, they will roll 4d6 
and select the best 3 rolls. 

Suppose the rolls result in 1, 1, 3 and 4. The character can now re-roll one
of the die having rolled 1, scoring a 6 instead, so the rolls are now
1, 3, 4 and 6. **Expert** is applied next, which allows to chose 3, 4 and 6,
for a total of 13.

If the re-rolled dice scores a 1 again, that result must be accepted
as final, unless other rules allows re-rolling a 1 roll for any other
reason.

> For example, this happens in many **resistance checks** against a sudden
death, or when covered by temporary effects that allow to re-roll any
dice scoring 1 indefinitely.

**Notice** that this advantage is opposed to **Unlucky**.
