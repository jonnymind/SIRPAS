## Total Mitigation

When the character receives an effective damage for 0 **DP** it still sustain a _scratch_.
This advantage prevents that.

However, other negative effects will still be applied. For example, if the character is
hit by a poisonous dart but the effective damage after all the mitigations are applied is 0,
while it won't receive a scratch, even with this advantage the poison will still be
applied.
