# Advantages

Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general 
or to a specific skill in particular, and that have a direct effect 
on some game mechanics.

Advantages can be bought for a certain number of **training tokens**
of a certain type; the more powerful the advantage, the more high
level the training tokens needed to train a point.

While most advantages are simply possessed by a character or not,
some can have different levels. In that case, the cost of
each ulterior point is the base cost plus one token of the same type
per level. For example, **Survival Instinct** can have a level between 1 and 4, 
each granting a higher modifier. The first level costs 3 **TT**/*Normal*;
this means that level 2 costs 3 + 2 = 5, level 3 costs 3 + 3 = 6
and level 4 costs 3 + 4 = 7 **TT**/*Normal*.

Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. 
For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, 
or having a certain attribute at a minimum set score.

It is also possible to acquire advantages for free, as a special reward for
a particularly brilliant deed; also, if an advantage is not needed anymore,
it can be removed, and half its total cost will be refunded (rounded up).
