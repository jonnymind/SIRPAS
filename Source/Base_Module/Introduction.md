# Introduction

This is the SIRPAS Base Module, also known as the *Foundation*. 

SIRPAS stands for "Simple Role Playing Adventure System". It's a modular RPG
system that separates the rules from the definition of the various statistics
used by the characters to move through the game.

The Base Module presents a set of generic statistics (attributes, skills, advantages and
perks) that should cover most adventure styles, game worlds and settings.

Further modules, describing specific settings and worlds, can use the whole
of the base module and add on top of it, or redefine and eventually discard whatever
element they want.

> The rest of this book refers itself as the *Foundation*.

## Jump into the action

This manual is organized so that you can skim through the main
paragraph of every chapter to start getting into the game. If you
prefer, you can read it front to back, but it's not necessary.

When you need more details, you can go back to the relevant chapter
and read the paragraph you're interested into.

Even more details about the rules are in the [Rulebook](@($BaseAddress)/Rulebook.html),
where every fine mechanics is treated in depth; the paragraphs in this
*Foundation* points directly at the relevant sections in the Rulebook.

At the end of every paragraph, there will be a link to the next one
so that joining the action is even easier. 

So, let's get into the adventure... and [jump into the action](#@(next chapter)).

## Somewhat standalone

The *Foundation* is designed so that reading the Rulebook in advance is not
necessary. You can read this manual and start playing right away.

As the various statistics are introduced, the underlying rules are briefly
explained, and the relevant section of the Rulebook is indicated, so that
it can be used as a reference as you go through this manual.
