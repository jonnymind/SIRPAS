# Backgrounds

Backgrounds are generic advantages and disadvantages giving 
deeper customization to characters in the game world. 

Whatever in makes the character stand out with respect to the vast
population is considered a *background*.

There isn't a net distinction between positive
and negative backgrounds: they all have a positive cost in 
**training tokens** to be spent at character creation. It is also
possible to receive the backgrounds as a consequence of adventuring;
for example, one can certainly become an outlaw during the course 
of an adventure.
