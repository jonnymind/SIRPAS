## Fainting

@(dd fainting)
{ 
  "*Name": "Fainting",
  "*Brief": "Must check when receiving a serious wound or lose a turn",
  "Category": "Disadvantage",
  "Cost": "1 TT/main"
}

A character with this disadvantage is subject to fainting when receiving
a serious or heavy wound.

The character must perform a **resistance check** against the source
of damage causing the wound. On failure, it receives the 
**fainting** status: the character is unable to perform any action for
about half a minute.

In combat, this translates in losing any action left in this turn
and skipping the next one; in this situation, instinctive defense
checks get a -3 modifier. Further wounds while affected by the
**fainting** status do not re-apply it.
