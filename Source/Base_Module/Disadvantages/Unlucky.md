## Unlucky

@(dd Unlucky)
{ 
  "*Name": "Unlucky",
  "*Brief": "Has a chance to worsen every check",
  "Category": "Disadvantage",
  "Cost": "2 TT/Main"
}

The character performs every check (except direct **resistance checks**) 
rolling an additional, separate six-face dice (suggest using a 
differently coloured one, if possible).

If the separate roll scores 1, the *worst* roll of the other die in the check
is substituted with 1.

For example: a character with **mastery**/*lockpick* attempts opening a lock.
As they have mastery on lock-picking, they will roll 2d6 and add +6. However,
they also must roll for **unlucky**. Suppose the roll for the check gives
3 and 4, but the unlucky dice rolls 1: the lowest roll (3) must be discarded
and changed into 1, so the check result will now be 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 instead of
3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Of course, nothing happens when the separate dice rolls 1 but one of the
normal dice rolls is 1 already.

This penalty is **not** applied on any **resistance check**.
