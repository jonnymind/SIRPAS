The character receives a penalty equal to the level of this disadvantage
whenever they must "move first" in a game situation. This includes, but is
not limited to:

* When they are the first in a **combat order** ranking, i.e. when they
move first in a combat round.
* When they are on the top spot of a **multiranking**.
* On the first check after winning a **ranking**, e.g. on the first action
once entering a house after they won the ranking to rush inside.

If it's possible to renounce being the first acting in a given context,
the character can chose if move first and face the penalty of this disadvantage,
or wait and move without penalty.

For example, even when having won a **combat order** ranking, characters are not
forced to move first. They can wait for any other moment in the round to act; if they
let someone else (enemy or allied) to perform an action first, they can then
act without any penalty.

Similarly, even after winning a ranking that would allow them to move first,
i.e. after being the first rushing in a house, they can forfeit the 
privilege of being the first to act, and let someone else (e.g. the second
in the ranking) to act first.

However, it's not possible to arbitrarily change spot in a multiranking. So,
if the character is first in their team in a multiranking, he or she will have
to score against the other teams top-scorer applying the penalty of this
disadvantage.
