}

This disadvantage makes considerably easier to score a critical failure
in every check.

Each entry in the [critical failure]($RulebookAddress#critical-results) 
table is increased of three points. The success margin for scoring
a critical failure becomes:

* Trivial: -3
* Easy: -4
* Normal: -5
* Hard: -6
* Very hard: -7

Also, in *normal*, *hard* and *very hard* checks a natural roll of 3 **or** 4 leads to 
an automatic critical failure, regardless of the negative success margin.
