## Vulnerable

  "*Name": "Vulnerable",
  "*Brief": "Receives extra DPs from the target source",
  "Category": "Disadvantage",
  "Specialization": "Damage source", 
  "Cost": "3 TT/Normal",
  "Levels": 3
}

The character receives 1 additional **damage point** from the 
target source, once at least 1 damage point is already received.

This is before the application of direct damage reduction; this
means that armors, force fields, energy shields, magic and so on
can absorb part of the additional damage.

Also, if the damage source deals 0 **DP** for any reason, the
additional damage generated by this disadvantage is not considered.

This disadvantage is specialized by damage source. It is to 
considered conflicting with any advantage that provides damage
reduction from that specific damage source (e.g. [hard skin](#hard-skin)
providing resistance against some types of physical damages).

On the other hand, a character may have resistance against some
specific damage and vulnerabilities against others. For example,
it may be resistance to cold but vulnerable to heat, both being
elemental damage sources.
