## Checks

> For the full description refer to the Rulebook **[checks]($RulebookAddress/#checks)** section.

Attempting any non-trivial action requires performing a *check* on a given attribute
related to the attempt to perform. For example, trying to push a cart stuck in the mud
may require a *check* on **strength**. 

Checks (abbreviated as **CHK**) are resolved by adding the value of a throw of three 
6-faced die (3d6) to the value of the attribute under check, and achieving total result 
of **21** or more, called **Success Level** (**SL**). The **SL** may be different when
the actions to perform are  easier or harder than normal. Other modifier can be
applied as the situation requires; for example, being wound makes every action harder,
applying a fixed penalty of -1 to -10 points depending on the severity of the wounds.

Each check has a **Success Margin** (**SM**), that is the difference between the
total value of the dice throw and the **SL**. On success, the **SM** is zero or
greater; on failure, the **SM** is negative.

When two characters attempt to perform the same action at the same time,
or try to stop an opponent from performing an action using another skill, 
a **Contest** happens. In this case, the success margin is the difference 
between the highest score and the other.

Finally, when there are multiple characters trying to best each other at a specific
skill (e.g. running up a hill), a **Ranking** (**RNK**) is performed. In rankings,
the winner has a success margin of zero, while all the others have a negative **SM**,
that is the distance from the first. When whole parties try to best each other,
a **Multiranking** (**MRNK**) takes place; each party performs a ranking, then
the scores of the same ranks in each party is compared (first against first,
second against second and so on); the winner party is the one with the most 
winning ranks.
