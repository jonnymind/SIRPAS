}

The character tries to acquire the control of the defendant mind. On success,
the defendant is unable to act (blocked). To keep holding the target, the attacker
must continue to use this attack with + 3 modifier against it at each turn. 

The attacker must maintain its **concentration** to keep the target blocked. Only
one target can be blocked at a time.
