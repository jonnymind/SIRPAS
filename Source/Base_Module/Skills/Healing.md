}

The character has advanced practical medical knowledge for the setting
where the adventure takes place, and is able to heal illnesses, poisoning
and equivalent conditions for the target settings, that may affect
biological living beings.

For instance, in a magic world where curses can cause illnesses, this
skill can also be used to treat the effect of the curses.

The type of illness determine the difficulty of the check. The following table 
gives a basic reference frame for deciding the difficulty of a check.

@(include /tables/healing.md)

Specific information about the setting will be used by the GM or directly
given in the descriptioin of the illnesses in order to determine the 
check difficulty.

The time required for the cure to take effect is in the order of hours to days;
the **Success Margin** can be used by the *GM* to decide how fast the recovery is.

Illnesses that are *difficult* or *hard* to cure will be transformed in *easy*
or *trivial* ilnesses before being cured. For instance, a successful cure of
*plague* will initially turn the illness into a *light feever*, which can then
be cured again to heal it completely.

Particular setting-specific devices can give determined bonuses in curing generic
or particular illnesses. Specific medicines or magic potions can give very high
bonuses (+12 or more) almost granting a success, even if the characters using them
have no healing skill at all.

A *critical success* will cure the illness completely and in record time.
A *critical failure* will cause another illness to appear (i.e. intoxication
from the medicinal active principle, appearance of secondary side-effects etc.).
