Disengage allows to break off from a melee engagement, and to move half the normal movement 
speed in the current turn. 

It automatically succeeds if there isn't any opponent currently able or willing to attack
the character using it. 

This skill can also be used against an incoming attack; in that case, it works as a
standard defense, and a combat **CNT** is performed between the attack skill of the attacker
and the **Dis** of the defender. 

If one or more opponents try to stop the disengaging character with something else
than a direct attack (i.e. grabbing or blocking them), a **RNK** is performed, 
and the disengagement succeeds only if the defendant is the top ranked.

On failure, the disengagement fails and the character cannot move; when used as a defense,
this also means that the attack has been successful.
