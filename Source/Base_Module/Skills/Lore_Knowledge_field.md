This skill represents the knowledge of the character about lore and stories in
the setting where the adventure takes place. The skill is specific for lore
types; for example, it can be targeted at norse mythology, egyptology, local
lores etc.

To check wether a character knows a specific lore it gets in contact with, check
against a difficulty which depends on how widespread the knowledge is,
considered the specific setting where the adventure takes place.
 
A lore everyone knows is checked as “trivial”, one that is particularly obscure
an known only to experts or initiates is “very hard”.
