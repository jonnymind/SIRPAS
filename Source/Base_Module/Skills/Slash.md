}

A generic combat maneuver that can be used with any weapon, 
including improvised ones. Clubs made out of table legs, 
guns without ammunitions used as maces, and in general anything you 
swing at an opponent without knowing exactly what you’re doing is 
covered under this maneuver.

If the opponent is unaware, the skill requires a **CHK** at *easy* level.

In combat, the opponent can use any defense, and a normal combat **CFR** is performed.

The damage type depends on the nature of the weapon. It can be either cut or blunt.
On critical success, it applies stun for 1 turns.
