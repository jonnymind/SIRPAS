## First Aid

@(dd first_aid)
{ 
  "*Name": "First Aid",
  "*Brief": "Field techniques to mitigate wounds",
  "Category": "Skill",
  "Cost": "1 TT/Normal"
}

This skill can be used to perform the following actions:
* cure a *light wound* with a successful *normal* check;
* reduce a *serious wound* into a *light wound* with a *difficult* check;
* reduce a *heavy wound* into a *serious wound* with a *hard* check.

Using a standard first-aid kit gives a modifier of +6 (some special first-aid kits
have higher modifiers). 

>Notice that no matter the modifier received with a first-aid kit, for what
concerns *critical results*, checks on 
*serious wounds* and *heavy wounds* are still *hard* and *very hard*.

The user can also cure more wounds on the same character; each further cured
wound requires adding the penalty of a *repeated check*, even if the previous
check is successful.

This skill can also be used to stabilize a disabled target with a successful *normal* check. 
Using a first-aid kit makes the check become *trivial* (no further modifier given by
the first-aid kit is applied).

A *critical success* (whether the skill is used to stabilize or cure a wound) heals another 
*light wound*, if the character has any.

A *critical failure* causes a light wound. If the skill is used to stabilize a dying 
character, a critical failure will kill it immediately.

If the skill is target of an [expertise](#Bam-a-expertise-skill) advantage, it can
also cure *serious wounds* instead of reducing them, and critical success will cure
up to an extra *serious wound*, if the target character has no more *light wounds* 
to cure.
