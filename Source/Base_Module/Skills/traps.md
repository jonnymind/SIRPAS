}

This skill represents the knowledge of the character about traps, and is used
to either detect, build or try and disarm traps, with the following modifiers:

@(include /tables/trap_modifiers.md)

Each tarp might come with a separate specific modifier in order to be
detected and disarmed. Once a trap is discovered (either through
this skill or by other means), the character might
attempt a separate check on Traps at easy difficulty to determine
its modifier prior attempting to disarm it.
