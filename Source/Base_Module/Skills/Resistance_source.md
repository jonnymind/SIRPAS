a determined damage source. The base of the resistance
depends on the macro-category of the danage source,

| Damage type | Base        |
|-------------|-------------|
| Physical    | Health      |
| Mental      | Equilibrium |
| Elemental   | Elem. Res.  |

The advantage [Elemental Resistance](BaM-a-elemental-resitance) gives
the base against elemental damage.
