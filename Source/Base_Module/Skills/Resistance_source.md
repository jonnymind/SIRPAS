@(dd resistance)

  "*Name": "Resistance",
  "Base": "H/E/-",
  "Type": "H",
  "Prereq": "-",
  "Spec": "**DP** source type"
}

The character has acquired a specific resistance against
a determined damage source. The base of the resistance
depends on the macro-category of the damage source,
as specified in the following table:

| Damage type | Base        |
|-------------|-------------|
| Physical    | Health      |
| Mental      | Equilibrium |
| Elemental   | Elem. Res.  |

The advantage [Elemental Resistance](#elemental-resitance) gives
the base against elemental damage.
