}

This attack consists in throwing a heavy object to an enemy in range.
Anything goes; even weapons, as long as the weight of the object is
between two and eight pounds weight.

The damage dealt is normally of __blunt__ type, unless the thrown object
is sharp; then it becomes of __cut__ type.

If the opponent is unaware, the skill requires a **CHK** at *normal* 
difficulty to succeed. In combat, a normal combat **CFR** against 
the opponent's defense is attempted.

A critical success applies also the stun condition for 1 turn.
