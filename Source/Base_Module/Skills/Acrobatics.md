The character is able to perform acrobatic feats, including falling from a
height that would normally damage a less skilled character.

If used to check if the character is hurt when falling from a height, the
following table indicates the modifier applied:

@(include /tables/fall.md)

Above 30 feet, the check fails automatically. 

When the check fails the character takes 1 damage point per feet.
