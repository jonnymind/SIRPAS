# Disadvantages {#BaM-gen-disadvantages}

Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be given
disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during
previous adventures, or as a background flavour, or in order to gain CP to be
spent elsewhere, in other statistics.
