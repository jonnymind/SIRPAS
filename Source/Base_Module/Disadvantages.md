# Disadvantages

Disadvantages are permanent penalties afflict the character.

A player can decide to apply some disadvantage to their character
before beginning an adventure, as doing so grants **training tokens** that
can be employed to make the character stronger in other aspects.

While most disadvantages are simply afflicting a character or not,
some can have different In this case, the player receives the base
value indicated in the description, plus the same amount of points
as the level of the disadvantage.

For example, **Nervous** can have a level between 1 and 3, 
each inflicting a more negative modifier. The description indicates that the
"cost" (to be intended as tokens refunded to the player) is 3 **TT**/*Hard*.
So getting level 1 grants the player 3 + 1 = 4 **TT**/*Hard*; level 2 grants
3 + 2 = 5 and level 3 grants 3 + 3 = 6 **TT**/*Hard*. This means that
players can get a total of 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 **TT**/*Hard* if they give
**Nervous**/3 to their characters.

Curses and other negative effects can temporarily or permanently inflict
disadvantages against the will of the players; in that case, they won't
receive any bonus tokens. It is also possible to get rid of a disadvantage
that the players don't want anymore, provided it was given to their
character on their own will, by spending an amount of tokens double the
ones received when it was applied (rounded down).
