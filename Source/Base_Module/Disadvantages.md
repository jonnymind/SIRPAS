# Disadvantages

Disadvantages are permanent penalties that the character is afflicted with.

A player can decide to willfully apply some disadvantage to their character
before beginning an adventure, as doing so grants **training tokens** that
can then be employed to make the character stronger in other aspects.

While most disadvantages are simply afflicting a character or not,
some can have different levels. In that case, the heaviest the
disadvantage, the more **TT** it will give the player.

In this case, the number and type of **TT** indicate in the the disadvantage description
is given when the character acquires the first level of the disadvantage;
any further level acquired will grant one additional training toke of that type
per level.

For example, **Nervous** can have a level between 1 and 3, 
each granting a more negative modifier. The first level grants 3 **TT**/*Hard*;
this means that bearing this disadvantage at level 2 provides 4 **TT**/*Hard* and
level 3 gives 5 **TT**/*Hard*. So,
if a character were to start its adventures wit **Nervous** 4, it would receive
a total of 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 **TT**/*Hard* to be spent on other 
attributes, perks or advantages.

## Penalty disadvantages

In some cases, a character can receive a disadvantage unwillingly. This may be
caused by magic, e.g. curses, or physical conditions, e.g. a necessary
cybernetic component of their body becoming unserviceable or being hijacked by
a malignant hacker.

Whenever a disadvantage is a acquired as a penalty, that doesn't give any
additional **TT**.

## Removing disadvantages

It is possible to remove a disadvantage. This can be done by:

* paying back double the cost of the disadvantage in equivalent **Training Tokens**, or
* by performing particularly worthy tasks in game, aimed directly at reducing or
removing the disadvantage. For example, a player may save a famous cybernetic scientist
in exchange for his help removing a defective cyber implant.

If the disadvantage has levels, it needs to be reduced to level 1 before being completely 
cleansed.
