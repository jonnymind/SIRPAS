## Blind {#BaM-a-blind}

*Cost*: -40 CP

The character is blind. A character can minimize the effect
of this drag through different means, but cannot use any functional
substitute of normal vision unless it refunds the cost.

For example,
having a dog companion that guides the character through every
possible obstacle is still blindness, but having the ability to
communicate telepathically with demonic minions and use their
sight, or using a cyber plant that provides visual sensor stimuli
directly to the brain is not allowed.
