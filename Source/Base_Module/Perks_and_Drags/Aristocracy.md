The character is an aristocrat in the target setting. In settings
that donâ€™t comprise a birth right, traditional aristocracy, the
perk grants belonging to a similar oligarchy or high-order political
elite.

The cost, and the effect of the perk on the game, depend on the
level of aristocracy:

* Baron, career politician, oligarch: 20 CP
* Count, party leader, organization leader: 30 CP
* Duke, minister, CEO: 40 CP
