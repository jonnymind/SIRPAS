A corporative is an employee of a company or governmental
institution large enough to define a vast part of their 
character and behavior.

For example, university professor, researcher, manager in a
multinational, engineer in a governmental space program are all
covered by this background.

Of course, the position must leave the character the possibility
to participate in the adventure. That may be justified as paid absence,
sabbatical, research project, special assignment, special operation
etc.

However, fort his background to be active, the character must always
retain the connection with the organization, and suffer the consequences
in case it breaks they break its rules.

While covering governmental agencies, this background doesn't cover law 
enforcement and military organizations, which are separately defined by
the [law enforcer](#law-enforcer) and [military](#military) backgrounds.
