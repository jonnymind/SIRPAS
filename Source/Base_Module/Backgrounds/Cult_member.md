The character is an active follower of a cult.
That includes any kind of cult, from major religions 
to minor local cults, but not secret sects or outlawed
cults; that is covered by the [Sectarian](#sectarian) background.

Being an active follower means to uphold the principles and
the practice of the rules with as little deviation as possible.
