The character is a fugitive in the eye of the law, whether
they have actually committed any crime or not.

In some game worlds, political or religious organizations
may be outlawed. In some others, characters with special
birthmarks, uncommon powers or attributes may be outlaw.

In some game worlds a person could become outlaw
because of ostracism towards their family member; that would
be the case of a king declaring the whole family of a
treasonous baron to be outlaw.

However, this applies also to real criminals, as a typical
outlaw in a western movie.
