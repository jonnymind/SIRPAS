## Wealthy 

@(dd wealthy)
{
  "*Name": "Wealthy",
  "*Short": "Chr. has personal wealth",
  "Category": "Background",
  "Cost": "2 TT/hard"
}

The character has personal wealth in excess with respect
to the population average, enough to be considered in the richest 1%.

This background doesn't cover the source of the wealth; it's to be
employed only when no other background that would usually result
in the character being wealthy cannot be applied. 

Reasons for this background to apply could be:

* While the family of the character is not part of the world
  aristocracy, it has accumulated wealth through trade and/or hard work.
* The character has received their wealth as an inheritance, a lottery win,
  a gamble, or any other random reason.
* The character found their wealth as a lucky consequence of a previous
  adventure, i.e. they stumbled on a treasure that wasn't supposed to be there.
* The character has a very lucrative activity in the game world which is not
  covered by any other background.

This background is not applied when the wealth of the character may be related
or explained by any other background (i.e. being a high ranking member of the
[military](#military)).
