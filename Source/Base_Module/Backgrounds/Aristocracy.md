## Aristocrat 

@(dd aristocrat)
{
  "*Name": "Aristocrat",
  "*Short": "Chr. is in the aristocratic/political elite",
  "Category": "Background",
  "Cost": "1+ TT/Primary"
}

The character is an aristocrat in the target setting. In settings
that donâ€™t consider birth rights as traditional aristocracy, the
the character belongs to a similar oligarchy or high-order political
elite.

The cost, and the effect of the background on the game, depends on the
level of aristocracy:

* Baron, career politician, oligarch: 1 TT/Primary
* Count, party leader, organization leader: 2 TT/Primary
* Duke, minister, CEO: 3 TT/Primary
* King, prince, prime minister, president: 4 TT/Primary

The background is applied also if the character is a close family member
(child, parent, souse) of a person in the given position. For example,
if a player wants to play the son of a baron, they will have to spend
1 TT/Primary too.

This background is not applied if the character is prevented from using the
social position for any reason: check the background "Fallen aristocracy"
for that.
