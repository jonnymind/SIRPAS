}

The character is part of a military organization, or organized
militia. This includes modern armies, knight orders, semi-regular
militia, legions and so on.

The cost of this background depends on the level occupied in the
military:

* Soldier: 1 TT/primary
* Sergeant, legionary: 2 TT/primary
* Captain, centurion: 3 TT/primary
* Colonel, general: 4 TT/primary

Of course, the character needs to have a reason to join the adventure.
This will usually be a special assignment, a long term espionage or
survey mission, or even a temporary license.
