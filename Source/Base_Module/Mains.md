# Mains {#BaM-c-mains}

The main attributes, or simply mains, are the base of your character. For a fast
adventure, you could simply set your mains and be ready to go, as everything
else depends on them. You could then fine tune other attributes and skills as
you go, or dedicate time to build your character before the sessions.
When a character is first created, the mains should express a value around the
mean of the attributes they refer to; for example if creating a strong but slow
character, it should be given a body value in between the strength, that will be
set higher, and the dexterity, that will be set lower.


The Body (**B**) is a value that describes your overall physical prowess in terms of
bodily strength, resilience to prolonged efforts, recovery speed, resistance to
illness and so on. For humans, it is measured in the range between 3 and 18 (the
possible outcomes of 3d6). Most adult characters score in the range between 10
and 12, with 18 representing a person with the best possible body (rarely if
ever ill, strong as the strongest wrestler or weight lifter, moving as swift as
a record runner and able to run as long as a marathon champion â€” all at the same
time), and 3 representing the weakest possible fully formed and barely
functional body.

The Mind (**M**) is the overall score of mental abilities in terms of intelligence,dcreativity, 
will power, mental sanity, depth of knowledge and so on. 
A mind level 3 represents a character that is barely functional as an autonomous person (or
creature) in the reference setting, while a 18 represents a character maximally intelligent, 
penetrating, knowledgable, sane and wise. The vast majority of characters (or heroes)
in the reference setting will have a mind between 10 and 12.
