This manoeuvre is the equivalent of a feint on a physical combat style. In case of success, it turns into a normal attack and delivers the damage as usual.
In case of failure, the failure margin gets added to the damage caused by the next attack. However, this modifier is lost if the character is forced to do any other action before attacking, or if the next attack is unsuccessful.
