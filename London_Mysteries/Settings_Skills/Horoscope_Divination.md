## Horoscope Divination (-)

The diviner can make a precise horoscope on a willing target (trivial difficulty), or if it has enough information, even on an unwilling one (normal to very hard, depending on the available information).
A success allows the diviner to know the overall character (in the sense, type of person) target of the horoscope. It will reveal if it is an upright, honest character or a born deceiver, or if it’s after power, glory, money, and so on. However, it cannot reveal what a target is currently up to; for example, evens characters very likely to be layers could occasionally behave straightly, if it’s advantageous for them.
