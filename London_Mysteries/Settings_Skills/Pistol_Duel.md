## Pistol Duel (D)

The ability to walk at a distance and shot a single-shot pistol at each other.
A normal success indicates a clear winner, but the loser is just scratched and doesn’t get any wound.
A critical success indicates the loser takes a heavy or deadly wound. To decide this, perform a second context on Pistol Duel; if the winner wins again, the wound is deadly; if it loses, it’s heavy.
