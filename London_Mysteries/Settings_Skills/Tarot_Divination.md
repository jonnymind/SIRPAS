## Tarot Divination (-)

The skill of divine the future using tarots.  The diviner can use it on itself, or on another willing target. A success gives the diviner an overall idea about the current situation of the target, and the possible outcomes. 
This comes useful when the situation in which the target is involved is not clear. For example, the target might be hired or involved into a seemingly upright task, but have some doubt about the real motifs of the employer/requester. In this case a tarot divination might reveal the fact that the character is being tricked into committing evil deeds.
