Allows to ask a question to a spiritual entity. If the entity is not hostile,
the caster must just perform a check against a difficutly depending on the nature
of the spiritual entity. If it is hostile, the caster must perform a normal attack.

The question must be posed in a form to be answered only by a yes, no, or 
don't know. The spiritual entity is compelled to reply sincerely to the best of
its knowledge; yet, the reply might not be true if the entity itself beleives a
falsehood.

On failure, or if the defense of an hostile entity is successful, the cost of
the spell is doubled, and the spiritual entity is forbidden from answering even
if it would be willing to do so.
