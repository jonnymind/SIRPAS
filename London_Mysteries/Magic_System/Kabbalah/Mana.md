### Mana

Mana is the mythical nourishment for the spirit that the caster needs in order
to use the Kabbalah successfully.

Initially, it is the double of the level of Kabbalah. So, a character with
Kabbalah 10 will start its adventure with a pool of 20 mana.
Once depleted, if the character is in good health (no serious or worse wounds),
and its body is well fed and not suffering any particular fatigue, Mana will be
naturally replenished at the rhythm of the same number of points as the level of
Kabbalah each “day” (complete and satisfactory cycle of sleep and wake), to the
maximum of the double of the Kabbalah level.

Other than the natural recovery, Mana can be found and absorbed in many ways, for example:

* Reading grimoires.
* Praying at sacred locations.
* Resting in power nodes (special locations of the Earth where the primordial power runs more abundant).
* Drinking specifically created elixirs.
* Receiving it directly from supernatural beings.

Generally, once a source of Mana is absorbed, it will become unusable, at least
for the same character. An elixir can be drunk just once, but while a grimoire
can be read as many times as desired, the same character reading it again will
not gain any further nourishment out of it (another character not having read it
yet might, though). Other sources might give off mana to the same characters
after some time; for example, a character might gain some mana by praying at the
same shrine/church/temple every week.

There is no upper limit to the amount of mana that can be accumulated this way;
however, natural recovery will replenish just the portion below the double of the
level of Kabbalah. 

For example, a character with Kabbalah 10 might have accumulated 80 Mana. No
natural replenishment will occur until it uses at least 61 Mana, going below 20.
Optional rule: a character having accumulated Mana for more than 10 times its
level of Kabbalah will start to give off obvious, involuntary and detrimental
signs of its power. For example, it may cause skin burns to people it comes in
touch with, its voice might become unnatural and scary, it might break delicate
objects in its vicinity by just walking by, and so on.
