### Mechanics

To cast a Kabbala spell, the caster chants the Verb of Creation, the words of
the Kabbalah. At each word spelled, the caster descends from the top of the tree
of life, representing the external, visible aspects of reality, down to its
roots, where the most powerful forces of nature dwell.

To progress to the next location, and unlock a magic effect in the process, the
caster must achieve a successful check (or contest, if the target is hostile),
with a -1 modifier at each subsequent step. A failure indicates that the caster
must start over again, from the top of the tree.

In order to move to a new node in the tree, the caster must spend a quantity of
Mana (spiritual nourishment) equal to the count of steps walked so far, starting
from one. So, to move the first step, it will have to spend 1 mana, 2 mana for
the second, 3 mana for the third and so on. At any time, the caster can
interrupt its walk and start all over again.

Casting a spell, and moving to the next location in the tree of life always
takes a combat turn. It’s not possible to speed up the casting (or slow it
down), except with magical means. This means that this art doesn’t get more
manoeuvres as it increases level, and there aren’t advantages giving more than
one manoeuvre per turn.

If the caster is attacked, it must perform a focus check in order to avoid
breaking the concentration. If the check fails, the caster needs to start from
the top of the tree again, but the modifier and the mana cost are reset to the
initial values as well.
