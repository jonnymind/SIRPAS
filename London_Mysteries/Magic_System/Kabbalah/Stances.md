### Stances {#BaM-m-kabbalah-tree-of-life}

Kabbalah has two stances: offensive and defensive. In offensive stance,
progressing forward from the top of the tree of life to its root produces a
negative effect on unwilling targets, while backtracking from the root to the
top will unlock defensive magic to help the caster and its allied. In defensive
stance, itâ€™s the reverse: progressing from top to root will unlock more powerful
defensive spells, and backtracking will generate offensive attacks.

The caster must decide its stance before entering in combat (if not, the GM will
chose one at random); to change stance in combat, the caster must suspend any
activity and dedicate a whole combat turn to the purpose.

Being interrupted during this process follows the same rules as casting: a check
on focus is required to complete the operation successfully.
