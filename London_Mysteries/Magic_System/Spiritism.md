## Spiritism

In London Mysteries, spiritism is a magic system meant to deal directly with
supernatural entities. Although itâ€™s possible to fight most supernatural
entities with mentalism, spiritism is far superior at that. It has also some
adventure-oriented utility, and some combat utility as well.

Spiritism is the ability to connect with, and possibly control, the spiritual
world of disembodied souls, demons and angels.

Connecting with the world of the spirits causes a great stress on the mind of
the spiritist. Each times a skill is used, the caster receives a certain amount
of positive or negative stress points. Basically, trying to contact or control
the supernatural entities gives positive points, while warding against them or
acting against them causes negative points.

The spiritist can be at maximum a number of point equal to spiritism from zero.
For example, a character with spiritism 8 can sustain a number of points 
between -8 and +8. Past that value, it will receive a typeless mental damage equal to
the excess points in one direction or another.

Using spiritism require to control the target spirits constantly; using spells
means repeating checks in order to maintain control over the spirits, or
continuing warding them, until a definitive success is achieved. Each of this
repeated checks gives stress points; this means that the spiritist are at risk
of receiving serious damage if they try to overstep their ability, and control
spirits they are not able to manage.
