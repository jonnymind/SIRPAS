## Spiritism

Spiritism is a magic system meant to deal directly with
supernatural entitities. It's the ability to connect with, 
and possibly control, the spiritual world of disembodied
souls, demons and angels.

Although itâ€™s possible to fight most supernatural
entities with mentalism, spiritism is far superior at that. It has also some
adventure-oriented utility, and some combat utility as well.
 
### Spiritism Stress Points 
 
Connecting with the world of the spirits causes a great stress on the mind of
the spiritist. Each times a skill is used, the caster receives a certain amount
of positive or negative _spiritism stress points_ (**SSP**) . 

Trying to contact or control the supernatural entities gives positive points, 
while warding against them or acting against them generates negative points.

The spiritist can sustain an amount of positive or negative **SSP** equal to 
its level of _spiritism_. When the absolute value exceeds that amount, it receives
an amount of mental damage equal to the excess, in absolute value.

For example, a character with _spiritism_ 8 has currently accumulated -6 stress points. 
If it tries to engage in a spell costing -4 **SSP**, it's count of **SSP** will go 
down to -8, and it will receive 2 points of typeless mental damage. 

If it tries the same spell again, being already at -8 **SSP**, it will now receive 4
mental **DP**.

**SSP** are never reset; however, the spiritist can follow spiritual based rythes to get 
stress points in the desired direction to bring them back to a desired level.

### Spell types

Spiritic magic is divided in three categories.

* Invocations (Inv): prayers to angels, demons or other entities that have a one-time only
effect.
* Summonings (Sum): the most common type of spiritic spells, they conjure a spirit that will
continouosly provide some special effect for the caster, until banished.
* Banishements (Ban): Attacks spiritual entities with direct damage, or removes them from this
plane of existence entirely.

### Spell conjuring mechanics

### Summon spell mechanics

Using summonings requires controlling the target spirits constantly. Once evoked,
the spirit will stay, and continue to deliver the same amount of **SSP** each turn,
until banished. No other action, except _free actions_ can be performed during that time;
this includes other spiritism spells, excepting banishment spells directed at the summoned
creature.

To banish a summoned entity, the spiritist must successfully cast a matching banishing 
spell. The summon spells will list which banisments are adequate.
