## Spiritism

Spiritism is a magic system meant to deal directly with
supernatural entitities. It's the ability to connect with, 
and possibly control, the spiritual world of disembodied
souls, demons and angels.

Although it’s possible to fight most supernatural
entities with mentalism, spiritism is far superior at that. It has also some
adventure-oriented utility, and some combat utility as well.
 
### Spiritism Stress Points 
 
Connecting with the world of the spirits causes a great stress on the mind of
the spiritist. Each times a skill is used, the caster receives a certain amount
of positive or negative _spiritism stress points_ (**SSP**). 

Trying to contact or control the supernatural entities gives positive points, 
while warding against them or acting against them generates negative points.

The spiritist can sustain an amount of positive or negative **SSP** equal to 
its level of _spiritism_. When the absolute value exceeds that amount, it receives
an amount of mental damage equal to the excess, in absolute value.

For example, a character with _spiritism_ 8 has currently accumulated -6 stress points. 
If it tries to engage in a spell costing -4 **SSP**, it's count of **SSP** will go 
down to -8, and it will receive 2 points of typeless mental damage. 

If it tries the same spell again, being already at -8 **SSP**, it will now receive 4
mental **DP**.

**SSP** are never reset; however, the spiritist can cast specific spells to bring them 
back to a desired level.

### Spell types and Mechanics

Spiritic magic is divided in the following categories.

* **Invocations** (Inv): prayers to angels, demons or other entities that have a one-time only
effect. It could be a single word of power or a rather long prayer, spawning several turns.
Once the invocation is complete, the effect is released and the **SSP** cost is paid.
* **Summonings** (Sum): the most common type of spiritic spells, they conjure a spirit that will
continouosly provide some special effect for the caster, until banished. The conjuring can be
instantaneous, spawn several turns. Once the summoning is complete, the summoner will pay the
required amount of **SSP** each turn, until the summoned entity is banished. The entity acts
on its own will, and doesn't require any concentration by the caster; however, the caser cannot
cast any other form of magic until the entity is banished.
* **Banishements** (Ban): Attacks spiritual entities with direct damage, or removes them from this
plane of existence entirely.
* **Long Rituals** (Lor): Ritual to contact the spiritual realm, taking more than a minute to set up.
They usually require a proper setup, and are extremely expensive in **SSP**. The effect is released at
the end of the ritual.
* **Utilities** (Uti): Performs actions at combat-time (although, not necessarily
while engaged in combat), which are not directed at harming or protecting a target.


### Interruptions

If the spiritist is interrupted in its casting, it must perform a **focus** check to avoid lose concentration.
If the check fails, the caster pays half the **SSP** cost of the interrupted spell, and no effect is achieved.
