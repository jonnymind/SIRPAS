# Introduction

“London Mysteries” is a Sirpas expansion. It presents the settings of Victorian
London, in the bustling years after the Industrial Revolution, with large space
for adventures, social climbers, intellectuals and engineers to raise to
prominent positions in society.

It is also the theatre of the struggle between occult societies to gain
prominence, and enlarge their influence.

This setting can be the base to play investigative adventures, as Sherlock
Holmes styled private investigators or horror/supernatural oriented stories; or,
like the late Sherlock Holmes, any viable mix of the two.
