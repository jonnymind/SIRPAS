## Horoscope Divination (-)

The diviner can make a precise horoscope on a willing target (trivial
difficulty), or if it has enough information, even on an unwilling one
(normal to very hard, depending on the available information).

A success allows the diviner to know the overall character (in the sense, type
of person) target of the horoscope. It will reveal if it is an upright, honest
character or a born deceiver, or if it’s after power, glory, money, and so on.
However, it cannot reveal what a target is currently up to; for example, evens
characters very likely to be layers could occasionally behave straightly, if
it’s advantageous for them.
