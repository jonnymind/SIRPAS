## Tailing (-)

This skill allows a character to follow a target without causing any suspicion.
On a normal success, the target will not realise being followed, but the check
must be repeated every 10 minutes, or every stop along the way (whatever comes
first).

A critical success means the tailing has succeeded automatically until
targetâ€™s destination.
