### Detect Clues (mD)

Find small, hidden and almost invisible clues that might pass unobserved on
crime scenes.

A blonde long hair, missing dust, a few grains of cigar ash; anything that
wouldn't be picked up by a pre-forensic police inspection, and requires a very
keen eye and insight on what to search for.
