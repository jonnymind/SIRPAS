London Mysteries takes place in Victorian London of the years between 1880-1899.

It provides an optional, low-magic system called “occultism”, which is mainly
focused on utility/support. Unless you’re dealing with supernatural entities
(i.e. ghosts or demons), you’re probably better shooting an opponent than trying
to curse it. Yet, occultism can make your hand steadier, and give you
that edge that might make the difference.

Similarly, if you’re wound, you might heal with alchemy or ceremonial magic,
but you’re probably safer heading for the nearest hospital.

The supernatural might totally absent, or included in adventures as a mere
flavour, and even treated with contempt and scepticism; or, if you’re more
inclined to Gothic ambient, it might be a central aspect of the adventure.
