London Mysteries takes place in Victorian London of the years between 1880-1899. 

It provides an optional, low-magic system called “occultism”, which provides
features as utility/support. Unless you’re dealing with supernatural entities
(i.e. ghosts or demons), you’re probably better shooting an opponent than trying
and curse it. Yet, occultism magic can make your hand steadier, and give you
that edge that might make the difference.

Similarly, if you’re wound, you might heal with alchemy or ceremonial magic, 
but you’re probably safer heading for the nearest hospital.

The supernatural might totally absent, or included in adventures as a mere
flavour, and even treated with contempt and skepticism; or, if you’re more
inclined to gothic ambients, it might be a central aspect of the adventure.
