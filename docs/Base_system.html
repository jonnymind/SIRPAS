<h1 id="BaM-gen-introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Sirpas stands for “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”. Everything here is streamlined and stripped to what you need to get your role playing adventures going, including the count of words in the descriptions.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking “adventures” here: a role playing session that can spawn for a casual night with friends, or with the family, or with strangers met at a gaming club. Systems thought for Role Playing Games are (usually) complex enough for you to invest lots of time in creating your characters, play through multiple sessions and use some time off to sort your past games out to get fun out of them.</p>
<p>Some may say that’s actually part of the fun itself. If you like the streamlined experience of Sirpas gameplay, you can play adventures spawning multiple sessions, or multiple adventures with the same characters, in the same world (this is often referred as campaign).</p>
<p>But you don’t need to. The idea is having as little commitment necessary to get playing, and then, pour in as much commitment as you want if you like it.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-gen-a-system-for-everyone">A system for everyone</h2>
<p>Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran players.</p>
<p>Who reads this manual and has never heard about role playing games before will encounter many new terms that have a special meaning in RPG, as “session”, “adventure”, “campaign”, “world”, “setting”, “character”, etc. Also, they might need on how to prepare, organise, manage, or even behave during a session. This is important, but it is not covered in this manual. This rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible; all the concepts commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger internet.</p>
<p>However, to help the beginners getting on RPG with Sirpas, depending on the media you’re reading the rulebook, we will:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>provide hyperlink to the description of the term.</li>
<li>highlighting terms with special meaning in RPG. A fast Internet search for “RPG” and the highlighted word will bring you to the description of the term.</li>
<li>Add a box named “For Beginners” near the relevant terms, that experienced readers can skip.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are Sirpas expansions dedicated to beginners, and the Sirpas Beginner Manual which actually helps beginners to successfully set up their first role playing gaming experiences.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-gen-play-any-world">Play Any World</h2>
<p>Sirpas is a generic role playing system, that doesn’t presume anything on the setting of your adventures. The system applies whatever your players might want to play; as normal people struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world, as wizards and knights in a high fantasy setting, as cyborgs in a SF plot, or even as AI in a virtual reality.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-gen-introduction">Combatless Adventures</h2>
<p>In most RPG settings, combat is a central part of the game action, if not the absolute protagonist. This leads to RPG systems being usually structured around the combat mechanics, and gaming sessions being mainly occupied by detailing combat actions.</p>
<p>Sirpas works the other way around: the combat system is simply the specialisation of the general system. As such, is possible to run adventures or entire campaign devoid of “combat”, and focusing either on other kind of contest (as i.e. skill battles in virtual worlds), or in other aspects of the role playing altogether.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a police drama as a RPG setting. While gunfights might play an important part in the campaign, the very nature of a gunfight doesn’t translate into interesting RPG mechanics, while more interesting actions as sword fights or martial art fights might not fit the setting.</p>
<p>As such, Sirpas focuses on a more differentiated gameplay, which can be as combat-intensive or combat-devoid as needed.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-gen-mechanics">Mechanics</h1>
<p>The mechanics are the ways the game works, in terms of what players actually do to move their characters through the adventures. Formally declaring what a character does, checking if an action is successful, checking which characters wins over a contest are all mechanics.</p>
<p>Sirpas mechanics are determined by statistics and checks.</p>
<p>Statistics are a numeric or qualitative description of some aspect of a character, for example a value of 12 in strength or a level of expert in lore knowledge.</p>
<p>Checks are performed on statistics in order to determine if a character can succeed in some action the player wants it to perform. They usually consist in throwing a set of dice and beating an odd which is determined by some statistic; for example, summing the points from a throw of three dice to the base strength, and surpass a certain total in order to slam a jammed door. In other cases, the check succeeds automatically if the relative statistics has a certain minimum value; for example, in order for the character to know about a certain legend, it must be at least expert in the relative lore.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-gen-statistics">Statistics</h1>
<p>In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that define a characters. They are divided in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes: important aspect of the character on which many other mechanics depend. For example <em>body</em> (<strong>B</strong>), <em>mind</em> (<strong>M</strong>), <em>health</em> (<strong>H</strong>) and <em>will</em> (<strong>W</strong>).</li>
<li>Structural Staticstics, or <strong>structs</strong>: A set of statistics that regulate how characters are structurally built; for example, how they receive and resist damage, how much stress they can sustain before going deranged, how many times they must feed or recharge in a day, and so on.</li>
<li>Status Statistics: values that vary fluidly during an adventure; for example, the amount of <strong>injury points</strong>, <strong>fatigue points</strong> etc.</li>
<li>Skills: specific abilities to perform some actions, as <em>hacking</em>, <em>lock picking</em>, <em>running</em>, <em>climbing</em> etc. They are divided into three categories, depending on the difficulty of learning and improving them: <em>easy</em>, <em>normal</em> and <em>hard</em>.</li>
<li>Advantages/disadvantages: Statistics affecting other skills, as example an expert modifier which increase the chance of winning checks against a specific skill.</li>
<li>Perks/drags: distinctive traits setting the character apart from the background people in the setting. Could be things a “famous” or “criminal”. They have an impact in the adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly some checks, providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.</li>
</ul>
<p>Attributes and skills are normally expressed as a value between 3 and 18, which is the range of value that can be expressed by summing the result of a 3d6 dice throw. A value of 3 represents the minimum skill level, or characteristic, that a character could have to be still considered minimally functional in the game world — a value below 3 would indicate a sub-normal characteristic. A value of 18 would represent the apex for the game environment, and the values between 10 and 12 would be the most common across the reference population.</p>
<p>The scaling is relative to the game setting. For example, if playing a campaign where the characters are Greek or Norse gods, a value of 3 on any statistic would probably express a level of proficiency far superior to that of any human.</p>
<p>Notice that the scaling is not linear: it follows the probability distribution of the 3d6 dice throw. For example, a character with strength 12 is just marginally stronger than one with strength 11, but one with strength 18 is in a totally different league than one with strength 17. Similarly, characters with health 10 and 11 have a very similar constitution, but one with health 3 will be much more gracile than one with health 4.</p>
<p>Different settings might introduce different ranges with other scaling rules; for example in a vampire society, the Body attribute (<strong>B</strong>) could be measured in a 0-100 range, where a B0 for a vampire would be equivalent to a B18 for a human, and where the difference between B0 and B1 and between B49 and B50 is the same.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-status-statistics">Status Statistics</h2>
<p><em>Status statistics</em> are a set of values that determines the current status of the character. The base system defines the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Injury points</em> (<strong>IP</strong>): amount of damage currently sustained by a character. Damage has different effects on different type of charactrs, so <strong>IP</strong> might mean different things to different type of characters.</li>
<li><em>Fatigue points</em> (<strong>FgP</strong>): current amount of physical tiredness.</li>
<li><em>Stress points</em> (<strong>StP</strong>): current amount of mental tiredness.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other subsystem in this manyual introduce more status statistics; for example different kind of <em>magic</em> systems have <em>mana points</em>.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-structs">Structural Statistics</h2>
<p><em>Structural Statistics</em>, or more simply <strong>structs</strong>, are special statistics descrbing the overall structure of the character.</p>
<p>They are defined in the base system as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Injury Reistance</em> (<strong>IR</strong>): number of <em>injury points</em> a character can take before becoming <em>incapacitated</em>. A normal human has <strong>IR</strong> 9, which can be slightly increased through advantages.</li>
<li><em>Fatigue Resistance</em> (<strong>FgR</strong>): number of <em>fatigue points</em> a character can take before becoming <em>incapacitated</em>. A normal human has <strong>FgR</strong> 9, which can be slightly increased through advantages.</li>
<li><em>Stress Resistance</em> (<strong>StR</strong>): number of <em>stress points</em> a character can take before becoming <em>incapacitated</em>. A normal human has <strong>FgR</strong> 9, which can be slightly increased through advantages.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BaM-m-base">Base and Specific Values</h2>
<p>Statistcs are organized in a hierarchy, where a lower level statistics (as i.e. a skill) may depend on a higher level one (i.e. an attribute).</p>
<p>The &quot;parent&quot; statistic provides a &quot;default&quot; value for all its children, called <strong>base</strong>. Other than the base, each statistic has a <strong>specific value</strong>, which represent a specific training or ability that the character has acquired on a particular attribute or skill, which makes it better than what another character with the same <strong>base</strong> would have.</p>
<p>The actual value of any statistic is the sum of the <strong>base</strong> and the <strong>specific value</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, the skill <a href="#BaM-s-hiding">hiding</a> is based on the attribute <em>intelligence</em>. This means that any any character has the ability to hide, and the value of the skill is the same as its <em>intelligence</em>, and if its intelligence increases, so does its hiding ability. However, a character may learn some simple tricks to improve its ability to hide without having to increase its overall intelligence, which is certainly more difficult.</p>
<p>To reflect this fact, the character sheet, all the information about a character are recorded, has a place to store the <strong>specific value</strong> besides the actual value of the statistic. In this way, when a base changes, it's easy to recompute the actual value of each statistic.</p>
<p>In the above example, suppose that a character has learned how to hide better, acquiring 3 points of <strong>specific value</strong> in <a href="#BaM-s-hiding">hiding</a>; its intelligence is 13, and that gives a total of 16. Suppose that the character improves its intelligence, which becomes 14. The player will go through the list of skills for which she has acquired any <strong>specific value</strong>, and that are based on <em>intelligence</em>; knowing that the <strong>specific value</strong> of <a href="#BaM-s-hiding">hiding</a> is 3, she will update the total value from 16 to 17.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-baseless-statistic">Baseless Statistics</h3>
<p>Not every statistics has a base. Some skills can't be &quot;improvised&quot; naturally, and must be learned specifically. For example, everyone can swing a sword, but learning a style of swordsmanship is a completely different matter.</p>
<p>Statistics without a base can be used only with a specific training: to use them, the character must have at least one point of <strong>specific value</strong> for them.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-difficulty-and-bases">Difficulty and Bases</h3>
<p>While some statistics are baseless, not all those have a certain parent have the same base. Some skills are more difficult than others, and the value of the parent attribute can only provide a minimal basic proficiency.</p>
<p>Normally, <em>easy</em> skills receive the full value of their base, <em>normal</em> skills only half of it (rounded down), and <em>hard</em> skills get a third of their base (again, rounded down); special bases could be assigned in particular cases, when the rules specify it.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-m-attributes">Attributes</h1>
<p>Attributes describe a character as syntetically as possible. They are the most important statistics, on which many other ones depend directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Attributes are organized in hierarchies, with top-level attributes called <strong>mains</strong>.</p>
<p>The base systems defines the following attributes: * Body (<strong>B</strong>): The phyisical aspect of the character. Body attributes are: * Strength (<strong>S</strong>): raw phisical power; * Dexterity (<strong>D</strong>): speed, precision and control over actions performed with the body; * Health (<strong>H</strong>): Resilience against fatigue, injury and illness. * Mind (<strong>M</strong>): describes the mental prowess of a character. Mind attributes are: * Will (<strong>W</strong>): strength of conviction and assertiveness. * Intelligence (<strong>I</strong>): ability to understand and solve complex problems; mental flexibility. * Equilibrium (<strong>E</strong>): resilience to mental strain, stress and madness.</p>
<p>Higher level attributes form the <strong>base</strong> of lower level ones. This meanst that the lower attributes are computed <em>by difference</em> with respect to their base. They start off as having the same value, and extra point can be bought (or sold) at a &quot;discount price&quot;, in order to increase them specifically.</p>
<p>For example, initially, a character with M12 has also W12, I12 and E12. If the player buys one point of <strong>will</strong>, it will be now W13. If later on the player decides to buy a point of <strong>mind</strong>, the attribute values will now M13, I13 and E13, but having bought a point of <strong>will</strong> already, that will now be W14. Of course, the cost of buying points for higher level attributes is proportionally larger.</p>
<p>A simple game session might be run by determinging nothing but the <strong>mains</strong>. If more time is spent in creating the characters, or as the game progresses, the lower level statistics can be finetuned and differentiated with respect to their parent attributes in the hyerarchy.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-c-body">Body</h2>
<p>The Body (<strong>B</strong>) is a value that describes your overall physical prowess in terms of bodily strength, resilience to prolonged efforts, recovery speed, resistance to illness and so on. For humans, it is measured in the range between 3 and 18 (the possible outcomes of 3d6). Most adult characters score in the range between 10 and 12, with 18 representing a person with the best possible body (rarely if ever ill, strong as the strongest wrestler or weight lifter, moving as swift as a record runner and able to run as long as a marathon champion — all at the same time), and 3 representing the weakest possible fully formed and barely functional body.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-strength">Strength</h3>
<p>Strength (<em>S</em>) is the attribute measuring a character physical strength. In the default setting, it also indicates how much weight the character can transport without being fatigued, or the amount of weight it can carry without being slowed down, or that it can lift. There are different tiers used in various occasion, all multiple of the value of Strength in pounds:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="center">Weight</th>
<th>Transport</th>
<th>Lift</th>
<th>Movement</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center">&lt;= <em>S</em> x 1 </td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">&gt; <em>S</em> x 5</td>
<td>Very Hard</td>
<td>Very Hard</td>
<td>1/3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The name of the tiers match the names of the skill difficulty levels, as they are directly applied as a difficulty level in various checks. However, they also define other effects that are not directly related with skills; for example, the transport weight tier is applied directly to the combat movement: a character transporting a “very hard” weight has its movement cut to one third of it normal movement</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-dexterity">Dexterity</h3>
<p>Dexterity (<strong>D</strong>) expresses the ability to control one’s own body. Eye-hand coordination, agility, reaction times and rapidity are all components of dexterity. A dexterity of 3 indicates sluggish reaction times, 18 indicates a martial-art or olympic gymnast level of dexterity, with the vast majority of common people stacking around 10-12.</p>
<p>The <em>dexterity</em> indicates also the base movement speed of a character. The actual speed depends on what a character actually is; a cyborg with <em>D</em>12 will probably be faster than any human with <em>D</em>18.</p>
<p>The following table is for humans; you can adapt it to other races by using the <em>speed coefficient</em> of that race (for humans, it's 1).</p>

<p>Notice that the speed for combat turn is not necessarily the sprint speed, as movement during combat is limited by other factors. Also, the combat turn here is the standard 10 seconds combat turn of the the base system; other systems might redefine the duration of a combat turn (and how <em>dexterity</em> works in those contexts).</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-health">Health</h3>
<p>Health (<strong>H</strong>) represents the resistance to fatigue, illness and polluted environment (including allergenic agents). It's used to determine how many <em>fatigue points</em> are generated in sitautions where the body is under strain, and gives the base for all resistance skills (i.e. <a href="#BaM-s-poison-resistance">poison resistance</a>).</p>
<h2 id="BaM-c-mind">Mind</h2>
<p>The Mind (<strong>M</strong>) is the overall score of mental abilities in terms of intelligence,dcreativity, will power, mental sanity, depth of knowledge and so on. A mind level 3 represents a character that is barely functional as an autonomous person (or creature) in the reference setting, while a 18 represents a character maximally intelligent, penetrating, knowledgable, sane and wise. The vast majority of characters (or heroes) in the reference setting will have a mind between 10 and 12.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-will">Will</h3>
<p>Will (<strong>W</strong>) is the power of the mind to focus on a certain task, perform prolonged mental activity, keep determination in adverse situations and so on. It can be roughly thought as the equivalent of the strength (<em>S</em>) in the mind realm.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
<p>Intelligence (<strong>I</strong>) is the ability to understand and solve complex problems, comprehend difficult study subjects, see through schemes and machinations etc. As it measure the flexibility of the mind processes, it can be thought as the dexterity (<strong>D</strong>) of the mind.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-c-equilibrium">Equilibrium</h3>
<p>Equilibrium (<strong>E</strong>) is the stability of the mind, or basically the equivalent of its health (<strong>H</strong>). It determines how much mental stress a character can sustain before receiving a <em>stress point</em>.</p>
<p>It indicates how much mental strain a person can take before being debilitated; of course, it is also important in those settings where attacks are delivered to the mind instead of the body: fantasy, sci-fi and horror settings can present as many dangers for the mind as for the body, or more.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-gen-modifiers">Modifiers</h1>
<p>In some situation, instead of using a statistic as a direct base, the system requires to use a base modifier.</p>
<p>This happens when some statistics are baseless by their own nature, but a base statistic influences them nevertheless.</p>
<p>For example, many combat styles are baseless, as you need to learn them from scratch to be good at those, but characters with a higher dexterity, or rather strength, are naturally better at it.</p>

<h1 id="BaM-m-character-points">Character Points</h1>
<p>Character Points (<strong>CP</strong>) express the amount of experience of your character, and with that, the amount of learning (improvement of its statistics) that the character will perform during the adventure, or in between adventures.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, statistics can be bought, and in some case sold, in exchange with <strong>CP</strong>s.</p>
<p>The amount of <strong>CP</strong>s spent to increase a certain statistic varies depending on the nature of the statistic, and in most cases, also depending on its current level. It is easier to increase low scores, and as the statistic gets higher, it becomes harder and harder to perfect it further.</p>
<p>As statistics are organized in a hierarchy, bying basic ones will influence more statistics related with them; as such attributes are more expensive than skills, and main attributes are more expensive than secondary ones.</p>
<p>This means that it’s usually preferable to invest in the desired skills in the beginning, and then increase their base at a later time. On the other hands, later adventures typically provide a larger amount of CP per session, so the decision wether to invest on single skills or on more powerful bases, while important, is not as critical as it might seem.</p>
<p>The following table describes how many CP must be spent in order to increase a statistic. Skills have different costs, depending on their complexity; the &quot;level&quot; value refers to the <strong>specific value</strong>, not the total value of the statistic.</p>

<h1 id="BaM-gen-checks">Checks</h1>
<p><em>Checks</em> are the nuts and bolts of SIRPAS. Practically every action that might succeed or fail requires performing a successful check on a specific skill, or more rarely, on an attribute.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-simple-check">Simple check</h2>
<p>A <em>simple check</em> is a test for the character to be able to perform a certain action, which requires a certain <strong>skill</strong> to be employed. For example, to verify if the character can land safely after jumping down from a height, it must pass a <em>simple check</em> on the skill <a href="#BaM-s-acrobatics">acrobatics</a>.</p>
<p>The skill descriptions indicate which actions are covered by each of them. When a character wants to perform an action not covered by a specific skill, one of its attributres are used instead; the Game Master decide which is the most adequate one. For example, if a character is trying to extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, the Game Master might ask to pass a <em>simple check</em> on <a href="#BaM-s-strength">strength</a>.</p>
<p>To <strong>perform</strong> a <em>simple check</em> means to throw three dice (or a different number, where the rules specify it) and sum the result of the rolled dice to the value of the employed skill or attribute. The rules might specify other modifiers to be applied to specific checks; for example being injuried applies a penalty to an check that depends on the seriousness of the injury.</p>
<p>The sole result of the dice rolls is called <em>natural result</em>, while the grand total of the <em>natural result</em>, skill or attribute value and modifiers is called <em>check result</em> (<strong>CR</strong>). To win (or <em>pass</em>) a <em>simple check</em>, the <em>check result</em> must be above a score called <em>success level</em> (<strong>SL</strong>) that depends on the difficulty of the action, according with the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Difficuylty</th>
<th align="right">Success Level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Trivial</td>
<td align="right">15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Easy</td>
<td align="right">18</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Normal</td>
<td align="right">21</td>

<tr class="even">

<td align="right">24</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Hard</td>
<td align="right">27</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Very Hard</td>
<td align="right">29</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This reference values are referenced by the skills description; many of them describe when actions are to be considered <em>easy</em>, <em>hard</em> and so on. When the skill description doesn't specify it, the Game Master can assign a difficulty modifier depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Instead of the generic difficulty level, which changes the <strong>SL</strong> for the ckeck, some skills can assign modifiers against a <em>normal</em> action (<strong>SL</strong>=21), depending on some situation; for example, jumping down from a high place requires a <em>normal</em> check on <a href="#BaM-s-acrobatis">acrobatics</a> with a modifier that depends on the height.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-success-margin">Success Margin</h3>
<p>The difference between the <em>check result</em> and the <em>success level</em> is called <em>Success Margin</em> (<strong>SM</strong>), and is of crucial importance in most of the rules. The <strong>SM</strong> is 0 or above on success, and less than 0 on failure.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-automatic-results">Automatic Results</h3>
<p>When a <em>natural 18</em> is scored, and if the action is of <em>normal</em> difficulty or easier, the <em>simple check</em> is automatically pased, regardless the <em>check result</em> being actually above the required <strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p>When a <em>natural 3</em> is scored, and if the action is of <em>normal</em> difficulty or harder, the <em>simple check</em> automatically fails, regardless the <em>check result</em> being actually below the required <strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> <em>easy</em> actions have an <em>automatic success</em> with a <em>natural 17</em> or better and <em>very easy</em> actions with a <em>natural 16</em> or better. <em>Hard</em> actions fail automatically with a <em>natural 4</em> or worse, and <em>very hard</em> actions with a <em>natural 5</em> or worse.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-repeated-attempts">Repeated Attempts</h2>
<p>In some situation, it is possible to repeat a failed attempt soon after the first try, either by the same character or by another one in the same group.</p>
<p>For example, picking a lock (when no one is around and there aren’t time constraint) can be repeated indefinitely by every member that could be able to open it, until a success is achieved, or unless the lock turns out to be actually impossible to pick.</p>
<p>Normally, any check that can rationally be performed more than once in a row can be repeated by increasing the <strong>SL</strong> by 2 points. For example, suppose you’retrying to break in an apartment; you have to perform a check on <a href="#BaM-s-lock-picking">lock picking</a> against a <strong>SL</strong> of 21 (a normal check). On failure, your character or another one in the group might try again, but this time the <strong>SL</strong> will be 23.</p>
<p>The time required for an attempt is usually indicated in the description of the target skill; if not, the Game Master decides how long any attempt should take, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>It is possible to attempt the action again with its natural <strong>SL</strong> letting a reasonable amount of time to pass. For actions taking a few moments, it will be after a long rest (equivalent of a good night of sleep). For actions requiring long preparation (i.e. studying the lore of a region), it might be a week or a month; if not specified in the skill description, the Game Master will decide.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-rankings">Rankings</h2>
<p>Ranking rolls (<strong>RNK</strong>) are special contests between two or more characters, ranking them in a order that doesn’t allow for draws. Also, in <em>rankings</em> the <strong>SM</strong> is not relevant.</p>
<p>For example, to establish the arrival order in a running relay, every participant rolls a ranking on the <a href="#BaM-s-running">running</a> skill. The order of arrival is decided once and for all, and draws are not allowed.</p>
<p>Draws are resolved by re-rolling on the same skill. The re-roll is only relevant for the relative order of the characters in draw. For example, suppose that, in said race, four character score a total of 26, 22, 22 and 20 respectively. Now, the second and third characters roll to decide their relative position; the winner of the two will be the second in ranking, and the looser will be the third, regardless of the score they realise now.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-contest">Contest</h2>
<p>Some actions are performed either in competition or against other characters. When this happens, a <em>contest</em> (<strong>CNT</strong>) must be performed. Both characters (or the Master in place of NPCs), must perform the equivalent of a <em>simple check</em> on a <em>normal difficulty</em>, trying to beat the opponent's roll.</p>
<p>Some contest can be asymmetrical: for example, an attacker will roll on some attack skill, while a defender will try and prevent the attacker success using some defence skill. The skill and combat sections describe some possible asymmetric skills, but players and masters (and other expansions) might come up with new ones if the situation suggests so.</p>
<p>The character having scored the highest result wins the contest, and the <strong>SM</strong> is computed for the winner only (and so, it is always positive).</p>
<p>Draws are normally allowed, and they might either mean that a new situation has taken by both characters having achieved a success at the same time, or nothing has changed as each character prevented the other from acting.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that two characters struggle to reach for a weapon during a brawl, with a contest on dexterity. If they roll a draw, it means both of them reached for the weapon, and now the situation has changed. A different contest may now take place: a contest on <em>strength</em> to determine who can pull the hardest. This time, if they have a draw, it means that none of them is able to snitch the weapon from the other, and they can try again.</p>
<p>Contests that don't allow draws are specifically indicated by the rules as <em>Drawless Contests</em> (<strong>ndCNT</strong>). In this cases, when a draw is scored, it is discarded as not performed, and another contest takes place.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-multi-contest">Multi-contests</h2>
<p>A multi-contest (<strong>mCNT</strong>) is a contest between two or more parties, each comprising one or more characters.</p>
<p>In a multi-contest, each party performs a <em>ranking</em> on the selected skill. Then, the best <em>check scores</em> from each party are compared against each other, and a point is assinged to the party having the highest <em>check score</em> of all. The contest continues comparing the second-best scores, the third-best scores and so on, until all the parties have a score to oppose to the others. Draws are discarded.</p>
<p>The party having scored the higest number of points is the winner; more than one party has totalized the same number of points, a multi-draw happens; depending on the context (and on the rules), draw might either lead to a new situation, or require the whole multi-contest to be repeated.</p>
<p>As there could be negative consequences for the losing parties, each losing participant will receive a negative <em>success margin</em>.</p>
<p>Notice that a multi-contest between two parties comprising just one character each is almost the same as a <em>direct contest</em>, with the difference that, instead of assigning a positive <em>SM</em> to the winner, a negative <em>SM</em> is assigned to the loser.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Three paties, composed of 3, 4 and 5 members respectively, try to run up a hill before the others. They perform a <em>multi-contest</em> on <a href="#BaM-s-running">running</a>. The rankings in each party result in: * Party A: 29-23-20 * Party B: 26-25-22-19 * Party C: 28-22-21-18-16</p>
<p>The points are assigned as follows: * A = 29, B = 26, C = 28 - Point for A * A = 23, B = 25, C = 22 - Point for B * A = 20, B = 22, C = 21 - Point for B</p>
<p>Group A has 1 point while group B has 2: group B wins the multi-contest. However, the first qualified members of group B and C will have a <em>SM</em> of -3 and -1 respectrively, while for what concerns the second qualified, it's the member of the group A that will have a negative <em>SM</em> (-2); also the second qualified of group C will have a <em>SM</em> of -3.</p>
<p>The remaning one member in B and two members in C are not participating in the <em>multi-contest</em>; nevertheless, the most numerous group has an advantage in having more chances to score high points than the others -- everything else equal.</p>
<p>The effect of the multi-contest in the adventure should reflect its outcome. In this example, the two highest scores in the ranking might have fumbled on the hill, or grabbed each other in a brawl, while the two winners of the winning party would have reached the top, nearly followed by the losers, and at a distance, by the ones excluded from the contest.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-critical-results">Critical Results</h2>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, a <em>success margin</em> particularly high is called <em>critical success</em> (<strong>CrS</strong>), and one particularly low is called <em>critical failure</em> (<strong>CrF</strong>).</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, critical successes and failures will result in particularly good or bad outcomes; when not specified by the rules or the skill description, the Game Master will determine how the outcome exceeds a normal result.</p>
<p>In a <em>contest</em> a <em>critical success</em> can be scored only by the winning party (as the <strong>SM</strong> can be only positive, and is assigned to the winner); hence, a contest can't determine <strong>critical failures</strong>.</p>
<p>The following table describes which <strong>SM</strong> are considiered **critical results, depending on the complexity of the action. <em>Contests</em> are considered <em>normal actions</em> on this regard, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Difficulty</th>
<th>SM for CrS</th>

</table>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: <a href="#BaM-m-automatic-results">Automatic results</a> determine also a critical result: they are <em>critical successes</em> (or failures) regardless of the value of the <strong>SM</strong>. For example, a <em>natural 18</em> against an action of normal or easier difficulty always determines a <em>critical success</em>.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-m-damage-and-injury">Damage and Injury</h1>
<p>A critical aspect of any RPG is the set of rules that determine how characters sustain damage and receive injuries.</p>
<p>SIRPAS has a modular injury system, which can be fitted in any setting and play styles.</p>
<p>It can be used to determine an overall status of a fight, or to determine precisely which part of a human body, mechanical robot, flying mount or AI virtual device has been damaged, and to what extent it has been incapacitated.</p>
<p>It can be employed to keep the score of harmless intellectual challenges, as well as devastating psychic attacs on the mental sanity of the characters.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-damage-points">Damage Points</h2>
<p>The <em>raw damage</em> a character receives is measured in <em>damage points</em> (<strong>DP</strong>).</p>
<p>Damage can come in the way of characters in various forms, and from various sources; hence, <strong>DP</strong> have also a <em>quality</em>, which depends on which source is generating them.</p>
<p>Physical harm, fatigue, heat, cold, mental stress etc. can be source. The base system divides them in three main categories: <em>physical</em>, <em>mental</em> and <em>elemental</em>. These macro-categories further subdivided in specific <em>damage sources</em>, which are defined further down.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-effective-damage">Effective Damage</h2>
<p>Incoming <em>raw damage</em> is modified through the application of <em>defences</em>, that reduce it in various ways; they are mainly divided in the following categories: * <em>Passive Defences</em>: reducing the incoming <strong>DP</strong>s of a flat amount (like physical armors), or dividing the damage by a certain factor, i.e. 4/5 or 3/4 (like magic or sci-fi shields), or eventually by an hybrid formual (as in the case of specific resistances against some kind of damage). * <em>Active Defences</em>: the amount of reduced <strong>DP</strong>s depends on the use of a certain character ability.</p>
<p>The way different kind of damages impact on the characters is fully considerd by the way defences are applied to reduce the incoming <strong>DP</strong>s.</p>
<p>The count of <strong>DP</strong>s left after the defences are applied is called <em>effective damage</em> (<strong>ED</strong>), and is used to evaluate the effect of the damage on the character.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-wounds">Wounds and Injury Points</h2>
<p>When sustaining a certain amount of damage, the character receive a certain kind of wound: a <em>scratch</em> or a <em>light</em>, <em>serious</em> or <em>heavy</em> wound, and possibly even <em>deadly</em> ones, according with the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th align="right"><strong>ED</strong></th>
<th>Wound</th>
<th align="right"><strong>IP</strong></th>
<th align="right">Modifier</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">0</td>
<td>Scratch</td>
<td align="right">-</td>
<td align="right">-</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="right">1-3</td>
<td>Light</td>
<td align="right">1</td>
<td align="right">-</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">4-6</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="right">10+</td>
<td>Deadly</td>
<td align="right">-</td>
<td align="right">-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The severity of the received wound determines the amount of <em>injury points</em> (<strong>IP</strong>) currently sustained by a certain character; once the <strong>IP</strong>s are above the maximum a character can sustain (its <em>injury resistance</em>), it becomes <em>incapacitated</em>, and it may eventually die, if the wounds are not treated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example: A human has normally <strong>IR</strong> 9; this means it can sustan 1 light wound and 2 heavy wounds, or 4 serious wounds, before becoming unable to act, and possibly unconscious.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In many RPGs, a form of <em>health</em>, <em>constitution</em> or similar statistic determines how how much damage a character can take. In SIRPAS, <strong>IR</strong> serves this purpose, and it's mostly fixed; more than stacking a single statistic, characters can acquire multiple resistances, skills and advantages to become progressively less affected by the same amount of damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Scratches</em> and <em>deadly wounds</em> are treated differently.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-wounds">Wounds Penalty</h3>
<p>A serious wound causes a penalty of -1, and a heavy wound causes a penalty of -2, on every action.</p>
<p>For example, if a character receives an heavy and a serious wound, every action requiring a check will be penalized by 3 points.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-scratches">Scratches</h2>
<p>A character hit by a damage source and reducing the <strong>ED</strong> to zero receives a <strong>scratch</strong> (although there are some situations in which a not even a scratch is received).</p>
<p>Scratches are extremely light wounds that, by themselves, don't impact the character <strong>IP</strong> pool.</p>
<p>However, once received a certain number of scratches, they are considered as one light wound. This number (namely a <strong>structural statistic</strong>) is called <em>scratch-to-wound</em> (<strong>StW</strong>), and it's 3, unless differently specified, for any character. No matter if we're talking of a dragon, a vampire, a god, an AI or a human, when they receive their equivalent of 3 scratches, they totalize a light wound, unless differently specified.</p>
<p>Practically, the players will note down the received scratches, and when they amount to their <em>StW</em>, they will remove the scratches and assign a light wound to themselves.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-deadly-wounds">Deadly Wounds (optional)</h2>
<p>When a character receives more than 9 <em>ED</em> points, it sustains a wound that is potentially able to kill them immediately.</p>
<p>To avert an immediate death, the character must pass a <em>simple check</em> on the <a href="#BaM-s-resistance-source">resistance</a> skill for the specific damage source.</p>
<p>When character can't use any specific resistance skill, the check is performed on <strong>body</strong>, if the damage is physical, or <strong>mind</strong>, if it's mental.</p>
<p>If the check is successful, the character receives a <em>heavy wound</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the <em>resistance check</em> has a negative modifier depeding on the received wounds, as any other action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="BaM-m-direct-wounds">Direct Wounds</h2>
<p>In some situation, a character can receive a wound of a certain kind directly, and not as a consequence of a damage source dealing damage points. For instance, certain magic spells could cause a heavy wound directly, if the character fails an attempt to resist them. A overwhelmingly powerful weapon, for example a starship laser directed against a human, could have the same effect. Explicit actions performed on the character when it is unable to defend itself (i.e. forms of physical or mental torture) could deal an arbitrary wound as the attacker seems fit, etc.</p>
<h2 id="localized-wounds-bam-m-localized-wounds">Localized Wounds {BaM-m-localized-wounds}</h2>
<p>By default, wounds are generally directed in the generic direction of the body, but some abilities allow to aim a certain specific part of the body.</p>
<p>When a wound is localized on a specific body part (an arm, a leg), any action involing that body part receives the double amount of penalty from that wound type. For instance, a <em>heavy wound</em> localized on a leg will cause every action to receive a penalty of -2 points, but the penalty will be -4 on <em>running</em>, <em>jumping</em>, and anything specifically involving that body part.</p>
<p>This extends to non human and even virtual body parts as well: and AI receiving a heavy wound on a virtual device will have a double penalty if it tries to use that device to perform any action.</p>
<p>A wound localized on the head adds an extra penalty point on every action. Specifically, a light wound on the head will cause a penalty of -1, a serious wound a penalty of -2, and a heavy wound a penalty of -3 on every action performed by the character. Again, this extends to non human body parts too: and AI hit on its virtual core will follow the same rule.</p>
<h2 id="damage-type">Damage Type</h2>
<p>Physical and mental damage are further divided in sub-types towards which characters might have specific resistances.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-elemental-damage">Elemental Damage</h3>
<p>Damage caused by energy, or in general, by life-threatening conditions the character might be subject to, is called elemental damage. It is important do determine which kind of elemental damage is sustained, as some characters can have resistance to some kind of element, while other might have a specific weakness.</p>
<p>All elemental damage cause physical damage, unless differently specified. For example, the fantasy element <em>pure magic</em> generates mental damage.</p>
<p>Elemental damage bypasses specific mental or physical resistances, but not generic resistances. For example, a flame thrower will generate heat damage, against which any specific cut, piercing and blunt damage resistance is useless; however, a generic resistance to physical damage would still apply.</p>
<p>The elemental damage types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chemical</em>: includes acid and any poisonous substance.</li>
<li><em>Cold</em>: for example, ice and unsustainable cold.</li>
<li><em>Electricity</em>: for example, lightning or electric shocks.</li>
<li><em>Heat</em>: for example, fire and unsustainable heat.</li>
<li><em>Light</em>: Some creatures are damaged by light (radiation in the visible spectrum). _Doesn’t include lasers (which generate heat) or other radiation damage.</li>
<li><em>Pure Magic</em>: metaphysical damage induced by magic, causing non-specific <em>mental</em> damage. Does not include magic spells creating a material effect (for example, causing something to catch fire) or directly attacking the mind (i.e. a hypnosis inducing magic spell).</li>
<li><em>Radiation</em>: for example, exposition to radioactive material, neutron guns, microwaves etc.</li>
<li><em>Void</em>: complete air pressure deprivation, i.e. the effects of deep space.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="BaM-m-mental-damage">Mental Damage</h3>
<p>Mental damage types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Despair</em>: The mental attack or stress provokes a state of mental exhaustion, akin with depression, where the victim is less likely to be willing to fight for their own life, or simply, to live.</li>
<li><em>Maddening</em>: The attack strips the victim character of its rationality, making its thought processes less coherent, and making it to believe things that are not true. It provokes sentiments of paranoia, terror, alienation, or alternatively, irrational boldness.</li>
<li><em>Confusion</em>: This kind of damage confuses the mind of the target, dumbing down its movement, altering its perception, provoking hallucinations and generally scrambling perception and memories. The thought process of the victim is still sound, and it usually recognises the hallucinations as not being real and can deal with the numbed sensations, unless it’s also maddened.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="BaM-m-physical-damage">Physical Damage</h3>
<p>Physical damage types are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blunt</em>: Impacts, falls, body slams and blunt weapons generate <em>blunt damage</em>.</li>
<li><em>Cut</em>: Sharp weapons generate <em>cut</em> damage, regardless of the weapon being used to slash or thrust. For example, a slash hit from a broadsword, a thrust from a pike and the wound caused by an arrow are all generating <em>cut damage</em>.</li>
<li><em>Piercing</em>: high-power weapons, with the potential to pass through the whole body of the target, and with high penetrating power against armours and covers, generate <em>piercing damage</em>. Guns, lasers, and high-yield crossbows are example of piercing weapons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that simple arrows are <em>normally</em> considered generating <em>cut damage</em>, as they would be stopped by the same kind of armour designed to stop other cut weapons, but some high-yield modern bow might generate <em>piercing damage</em> instead.</p>
<h2 id="conditions-and-status">Conditions and Status</h2>
<p><em>Conditions</em> are &quot;standardised&quot; negative effects that a particular damage source can add, other than causing a direct damage.</p>
<p>When a condition is applied to a character for a prolonged time, it becomes a <strong>status</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Wound</em>: A success causes an immediate wound — the seriousness of the wound being described here or in the skill description.</li>
<li><em>Block</em>: the target is grappled or anyhow blocked. The description of the skill will specified whether the attacker is blocked too.</li>
<li><em>Stun X</em>: the target is stun for a count X of turns, giving it a modifier of -2 to any action.</li>
<li><em>Fall</em>: The target falls on the ground, and is “grounded” for the next turn.</li>
<li><em>Disarm</em>: The target loses its weapon.</li>
<li><em>Cripple</em>: A limb of the target is crippled and becomes impaired. All actions requiring that limb receives a -4 modifier. If the crippled limb is a leg, 4-legged animals reduce their movement to half, bipedal animals (including human) to 1/4.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="BaM-m-skills">Skills</h1>
<p>Skills are abilities that a character can exercise at a certain moment, and They are usually based on a single attribute; this means that, if the character didn’t invent any CP in them, they assume the same value of he attribute they are based on.</p>
<p>Some are based on multiple attributes: their base value can be a mean of two or more attributes, or can be the best out of alternative attributes.</p>
<p>Some skills don’t have a base: they represent abilities that must be learned from scratch; for example lock picking must be learned before being used.</p>
<p>Last, some skills have a base that depends on a base modifier; this is indicated with a lowercase letter 'm' in front of the attribute.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-acrobatics">Acrobatics (D)</h2>
<p>The character is able to perform acrobatic feats, including falling from a height that would normally damage a less skilled character.</p>
<p>If used to check if the character is hurt when falling from a height, the following table indicates the modifier applied:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Height</th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>6 feet</td>
<td>Trivial</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td>Difficult</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>24 feet</td>
<td>Hard</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>30 feet</td>
<td>Very Hard</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Above 30 feet, the check fails automatically.</p>
<p>When the check fails the character takes 1 damage point per feet.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-active-mitigation">Active Mitigation (-; H)</h2>
<p>The character can mitigate a damage equal to the success margin once per turn.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-charisma">Charisma (M)</h2>
<p>Used to influence positively other characters. Not to be confused with <em>Persuade</em>. This skill is specifically meant for characters trying to make a good impression, obtain favours, special treatments, or a generic good attitude. Persuade is the skill to deliver one specific talk with persuasive power.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-chemistry">Chemistry (-; H)</h2>
<p>Technical knowledge of modern chemistry.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-climbing">Climbing (D; E)</h2>
<p>Used to check when the character climbs a section of wall 6 feet high. Use the following table to determine the difficulty of the action:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Surface</th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Ivy riddled wall</td>

<td>Rock Wall</td>
<td>Difficult</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Castle Wall</td>
<td>Hard</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Polished Wall</td>
<td>Very Hard</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If the character fails, it stays at its current spot, and it can try again with the repeated attempt modifiers.</p>
<p>A critical failure implies that the character fell from the current spot. A critical success indicates it climbed for 12 feet instead of 6.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-deceit">Deceit (I)</h2>
<p>It’s the ability to say a credible lie.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-endurance">Endurance (H)</h2>
<p>Endurance is the ability to resist long lasting physical strain. A long march, swimming, carrying weights for a long time etc. requires an endurance check. Subsequent endurance checks against the same condition are treated as repeated check (each of them gets a -1 modifier), even if other skills are used meanwhile.</p>
<p>For example, if a group is taking a forced march and has already passed a check, is forced to a fight and then resumes the march without any rest, the next endurance check will have a modifier of -1.</p>
<p>A success indicates that the character is able to continue the effort. In case of failure, the character needs to try again with the ever increasing repeated check, until success becomes impossible.</p>
<p>A critical success causes the next repeated check to be won automatically, and the current repeated modifier is also reduced by 1.</p>
<p>A critical failure indicates that the character is exhausted, and needs to rest. If it is in a precarious situation, i.e. swimming, walking along a dangerous mountain trail, it might be forced to roll against a deadly wound or die.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-engineering">Engineering (-; H)</h2>
<p>Technical skill in modern engineering.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-first-aid">First Aid (-)</h2>
<p>The character can stabilize a disabled target with a successful check. If a first aid kit is available, the check becomes trivial.</p>
<p>The character can also cure a fresh wound with a successful check; having a first-aid kit at disposal gives a modifier of +6 (some special first aid kits have higher modifiers).</p>
<p>The user can also cure more fresh wounds on the same character, applying a -2 penalty to for each further wounds cured.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-hacking">Hacking/System (-; H)</h2>
<p>When a character wants to hack a device or a system, it can roll on this to check if it has the necessary knowledge to hack the system.</p>
<p>Each action requires a different check. A critical failure implies the hacking has been neutralised and the source identified. A critical success implies that the character has gained privileged access, and further actions on the same system will not require a separate check.</p>
<p>The specifics of the system depend on the setting. For some settings, the hacking skill could be general, while in other settings specific systems will be identified, and they might require a separate hacking skill.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-healing">Healing/Race (-; H)</h2>
<p><strong><em>Prerequisite</em></strong>: <em>First Aid</em> 6</p>
<p>The character has advanced practical medical knowledge for the setting where the adventure takes place, and is able to heal wounds of the target creatures.</p>
<p>The following table is applied when checking for the character success:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Severity</th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Light</td>
<td>Normal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Severe</td>
<td>Difficult</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Heavy</td>
<td>Hard</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Specific healing aids in the target setting can provide other modifiers. The time required for the healing to be performed depends on the setting and on the device used. A SF cellular replicator or a magic balm could allow healing heavy wounds in one day, in a few hours or in minutes, while in other settings, an herbal healing remedy might require a week.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-hiding">Hiding (I; E)</h2>
<p>The character knows how to hide so to look like inconspicuous material (i.e. a sack of potatoes, a part of a load of straw on a cart, a roll of cloth and so on). The difficulty of the check is determined by the GM.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-hiding-in-shadows">Hiding in Shadows (mD)</h2>
<p>The character knows how to hide in dark places, or pass unobserved in a crowded place.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-initiative">Initiative (D/W; H)</h2>
<p>This skill represents the reaction times and determination under pressure of the character. It is typically used in contests or rankings, to decide who acts first during a stalemate, but it can be also used in checks. The order in which a combat turn develops is decided by a ranking on the initiative of all the involved characters.</p>
<p>The base is either Dexterity or Will, the best of the two.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-intimidate">Intimidate (W)</h2>
<p>Intimidate is the action of menacing someone that some negative outcome will follow, unless they don’t comply with some desired course of actions. For intimidation to be effective, the menace must be credible, and the target must actually wish for that not to happen.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-investigation">Investigation (I; H)</h2>
<p>The ability to find hidden clue or draw correct conclusions with a limited amount of clue. Particularly useful when visiting the scene of a crime.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-lie-detection">Lie Detection (mI; H)</h2>
<p>This skill represents the ability of the character to detect lies, given small hints on the voice, facial expressions and behaviour of the target.</p>
<p>A skilled lier can oppose its deception. Otherwise, the character can try a check on this skill, with a difficulty that depends on the amount of information the character has about the truth.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-lock-picking">Lock Picking (-)</h2>
<p>Used to try opening normal locks. The lock must be within the reach of the technological knowledge of the character. The character must have also proper tools at its disposal to try the action.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-lore-knowledge">Lore Knowledge/field (-; E)</h2>
<p>This skill represents the knowledge of the character about lore and stories in the setting where the adventure takes place. The skill is specific for lore types; for example, it can be targeted at norse mythology, egyptology, local lores etc.</p>
<p>To check wether a character knows a specific lore it gets in contact with, check against a difficulty which depends on how widespread the knowledge is, considered the specific setting where the adventure takes place.</p>
<p>A lore everyone knows is checked as “trivial”, one that is particularly obscure an known only to experts or initiates is “very hard”.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-perception">Perception (W; H)</h2>
<p>Determines whether the character is able to detect an element in the surrounding that is hard to spot, as a secret door, a potential danger, a follower and so on.</p>
<p>It is used when there aren’t more specific skills to be applied in the specific situation. For example, trying to find traps is done by rolling on traps.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-persuade">Persuade (I)</h2>
<p>With this skill, the character can persuade others. Persuading means leading others to believe the truth of some idea, fact or point of view (regardless of them being actually true or not). Persuasion works on characters that don’t have strong evidence or didn’t made up their mind already on said idea, fact or point of view.</p>
<p>Persuasion can also be used to convince someone into performing some action, or abstaining to perform some action they should do, provided the consequences for doing so are not particularly harsh. For example, you can persuade some security guards to let you in a restricted party, provided they don’t have categorical orders, or provided that they think they can get away with a transgression.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-pickpocket">Pickpocket (hD)</h2>
<p>Tires to remove objects from another characters. The objects must not be secured to its body for the action to be successful. Use the following table to determine the difficulty of the action:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Target awareness</th>
<th>Modifier</th>

<h2 id="BaM-s-riding">Riding/mount (mD)</h2>
<p>This skill is used to perform particularly difficult actions while riding a specific animal. For example, jumping a fence with a horse, jumping across acrobatic platforms with a motor bike, running through a busy skyline with a flying car and so on.</p>
<p>The skill is specific for each device (or animal) that the character might ride. Some riding specialisation can be baseless, if learning them requires a specific preparation (for example, helicopter pilot).</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-running">Running (D)</h2>

<h1 id="BaM-gen-advantages">Advantages</h1>
<p>Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general or to a specific skill in particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics.</p>
<p>While most advantages are simply possessed by a character or not, some can have different levels. For example, Survival Instinct can have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a higher modifier.</p>
<p>In that case, the description of the advantage indicates the initial cost and the cost per additional level. The cost of a further level is given by the base cost, plus the additional level cost times the current level. For example, if the description indicates the cost in <strong>CP</strong> being 5+2, it means that the first level costs 5, the second 5+2<em>1 = 7, the third 5+2</em>2 = 9 and so on.</p>
<p>Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in order to be acquired. For example, they could require having already acquired another advantage, or having a certain statistic at a minimum set score.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-battleproof">Battleproof (10CP)</h2>

<p>Skill Mastery (SM/skill) is an advantage that is applied on a specific skill. As a pre-requisite, the character must have already Expertise on the same skill.</p>
<p>Mastery changes all the checks using that skill from a 3d6 throw to a 2d6+6 (as if one dice is always automatically rolling a 6).</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-">Natural/skill (6CP)</h2>
<p>The character is a “natural” of a certain discipline. Difficult checks on the target skill get an additional modifier of +1, hard checks have an additional modifier of +2, and Very Hard checks have a +3 modifier. Without any other situational modifiers, the effective modifiers for difficult, hard and very hard checks become -2, -4 and -5.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-strong-temper">Strong Temper (20CP)</h2>
<p><strong><em>Preprequisite</em></strong>: <em>Hard To Die</em></p>
<p>The character can withstand an additional wound from physical sources before being incapacitated, and will not die in case the last wound received was from a physical source if not treated for 1 hour, regardless of the Injury Points sustained.</p>

<p>Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be given disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during previous adventures, or as a background flavour, or in order to gain CP to be spent elsewhere, in other statistics.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-lack-of-instinct">Lack of Instinct 1-4 (6/3CP)</h2>
<p>All instinctive defence checks and contests get a -1 modifier per level bought.</p>
<p>Cannot be countered by buying Survival Instinct.</p>
<h1 id="BaM-gen-perks-and-drags">Perks and Drags</h1>
<p>Perks and drags are generic advantages and disadvantages that don’t impact the game system directly. They usually give more flavour in terms of roleplaying, and better define a character in its settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being famous, of noble origins, being able to play a certain instrument, knowing a certain literature or scientific topic, being rich, and the inverse of those are considered perks (or drags).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can and usually will have an influence in how the adventure plays, and some of them has also some indirect effect on the rules. For example, Medical Knowledge is mainly meant for your character to be able to speak competently about illnesses and cures, but it also influences the rolls on First Aid; Criminal Boss is meant to direct your adventure in a certain direction, but it also influences the skill Intimidate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Baron, career politician, oligarch: 20 CP</li>

<h2 id="BaM-a-blind">Blind</h2>
<p><em>Cost</em>: -40 CP</p>
<p>The character is blind. It can still use this drag even if it has a substitute for normal vision, provided the substitute is just minimising the disadvantage. For example, having a dog companion that guides the character through every possible obstacle is still blindness, but having the ability to communicate telepathically with demonic minions and use their sight would invalidate this perk.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-criminal">Criminal</h2>
<p><em>Cost</em>: 10 CP</p>
<p>The character is an active criminal. It is in hiding and actively searched by the local law enforcement, and is in contact with other criminals and criminal organisations.</p>
<p>The character has an initial wealth of 25,000$.</p>
<p>Add 5 CP if the character is also member of an active criminal organisation. In this case, the character will have an initial wealth of 50,000$ and a monthly wage of 3,000$, but it must abide to the rules of the criminal organisation it is part of.</p>
<p>This perk grants a modifier of +2 to Intimidate.</p>
<p>Law Enforcer, Criminal Background, Criminal Boss and Criminal are mutually exclusive: the character can chose only one of them.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-criminal-background">Criminal Background</h2>
<p><em>Cost</em>: 10 CP</p>
<p>The character was a member of a criminal organisation, and has retained contacts with the ambient.</p>
<p>Characters with this perk have a +2 modifier to Persuade and +1 to Intimidate. Law Enforcer, Criminal Background, Criminal Boss and Criminal are mutually exclusive: the character can chose only one of them.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-a-criminal-boss">Criminal Boss</h2>
<p>Cost: variable. The character is the leader of a criminal organisation. It has a relatively large network of criminals that follow his orders, a consistent wealth and a flux of incoming money. On the other side, it’s known to relevant police forces, constantly at risk of being arrested and not always welcome in high social circles.</p>

<p>The cost depends on how famous the character is:</p>
<ul>
<li>10CP: Konw by 1/20th-1/10th of the population; people occasionally identify it when walking by, or tells it they heard about it.</li>
<li>15CP: Konwn by 1/5th of the population. During a day out, or a long walk, the character is sure to be recognized, and possibly stopped by admirers (or haters).</li>

<li><em>Simplified Combat</em>: It's a simple way to resolve small combats. It consists in a specialized form of <em>skill contest</em> applied to combat skills, which takes into account the relative ranking in the contests to determine winners, losers, and other possible outcomes.</li>
<li><em>Basic Combat</em>: It's a sub-system dedicated specifically to combat, using the combat skills with specific rules, and takes into account positioning, tactical advantages and other combat-specific elements.</li>
<li><em>Advanced Combat</em>: This is the full fledged combat system, extending the <em>basic combat</em> and using special sub-skills called <em>manoeuvres</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can mix and match these sub-systems in the same adventure, without limitation. You can either choose one or another depending on the experience of the players, or their inclinations, or you can base the choice on the relevance of the combat in the adventure. For example, you could resolve a brawl erupted in a tavern as a <em>simplified combat</em>, to turn to the <em>advanced combat</em> when things get nasty while fighting the guards to escape a dungeon.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-basic-combat">Basic Combat</h2>
<p>Sirpas <em>basic combat</em> is a sub-system employed when two or more parties are fighting each other.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-basic-combat-combat-turns">Combat Turns</h3>
<p>Combat is divided in turns. Normally, characters can perform just one action per turn, but certain skills and advantages grant the ability to perform more manoeuvres.</p>
<p>The length of the turn depends on the settings: it might be one second in a Wild West setting where gunslingers are fighting, ten seconds when considering melee fights in medieval settings, one nanosecond in fights between AIs, one minute in fights between giant robots or starships and so on.</p>
<p>For most situations, you’ll want to consider the length of a combat turn being 10 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-basic-combat-initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>Each turn, all the participants roll a ranking on the skill called <a href="#BaM-s-initiative"><strong>initiative</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Following the initialtive ranking order firtst to last, characters decide the action they want to perform among the wollowings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack</li>
<li>Wait for a better moment</li>
<li>Move</li>
<li>Switch Weapon</li>
<li>Use an item</li>
</ul>
<p>A character can use only a single combat skill during a turn, but some combat skills provide multiple <em>actions</em>, which means they can be used multiple times per turn to defend or attack.</p>
<p>A character can use the combat skill for defending against an attack also if it not its turn; however, when its turn comes, it will be able to attack only if it has some actions left unused.</p>
<p>A character might also decide not perform any action when its turn comes; if it does so, it can prehempt any other action performed later on by characters down the initiative ranking, or eventually use a defence to respond to a later attack.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-basic-combat-instinctive-defence">Instinctive Defence</h3>
<p>In some situations, the defender is aware of the incoming attack (i.e. has seen the attacker and is ready to receive the blow) but can’t use any defence. One reason might be that it already used all the defence at its disposal in a combat turn and can’t react any more, or it might be that it has no proficiency in that kind of combat — this often happens with metaphysical attacks directed at targets that don’t have a specific skill to use in response — or in case it’s explicitly dictated by the rules — for example, defending against any attack after using disengage.</p>
<p>In those cases, provided the defender is at least aware of the attacks, it can use either an <a href="#BaM-s-generic-combat-instinctive-defence">instinctive defence</a> (against physical attacks) or a <a href="#BaM-s-generic-combat-willpower-defence">willpower defence</a> (against mind attacks).</p>
<h3 id="moving-during-combat">Moving during combat</h3>
<p>It is possible to move during combat at the speed indicated in the <a href="#BaM-c-dexterity"><strong>dexterity</strong></a> table.</p>
<p>Opponents targeting the character (either because they are nearby in melee, or because they have aimed at them previously) can use an attack against them to prevent them from moving. In that case, the moving character must successfully defend with the (<strong>disengage</strong>)[#BaM-s-generic-combat-disengage] generic manoeuvre. If it fails, other than receiving normal damage, it also stays unmoved, and the action is nevertheless consumed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a character plans to move and there isn't any urgency to do that, it's better to wait for any opponent that might target them to use up all their attacks, so to be able to move freely.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="skill-range">Skill Range</h3>
<p>Combat skills are divided into <em>melee</em>, <em>ranged</em> and <em>metaphysical</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Melee</em> skills work when the combatants are in close range, and can physically harm each other without any projection.</li>
<li><em>Ranged</em> skills use a weapon, a projectile or any mean to physically project a harmful device or source of energy towards a target. Skills of magical nature might be ranged if they magically create a projectile, ray of energy or any physical mean to harm a target.</li>
<li><em>Metaphysical</em> skills require their user to know where a target is in order to direct the attack, but they have no physical range. The target could be on another planet, as long as the user has a mean to see, feel or simply know <em>instantly</em> about it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mixing-different-skill-ranges">Mixing different skill ranges</h3>
<p>In some cases, it is necessary to mix differently ranged skills as attack and defences.</p>
<p>For example, an archer could be overcome by a soldier armed with a sword. It might then be be forced, or simply prefer, to use its <em>archery</em> skill as its defence.</p>
<p>Similarly, a martial artist could spot a shooter, and decide to use its <em>full contact</em> skill to try and avoid to be hit.</p>
<p>When defending against <em>ranged skills</em>, a <em>melee</em> skill receives a modifier of +1 when defending in <em>melee</em> range (i.e. if they are in close quarters with the attaccker); if not, it receives a modifier of -1 for each 18 feet of distance from the source.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a martial artist using <em>full contact</em> against a shooter 40 feet away would have a penalty of -2. If the attacker were in melee range, the modifier would be +1, and six feet away there wouldn't be any modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When defending against <em>melee</em> skills, a <em>ranged</em> skill gets a penalty of -3.</p>
<p><em>Metaphysical</em> skills cannot be use to defend against physical skills, and the other away around, <em>melee</em> and <em>ranged</em> skills cannot be used to defend against a <em>metaphysical</em> attack.</p>
<h3 id="ranged-attacks-falloff">Ranged attacks falloff</h3>

<p>If a character has <em>full coverage</em> and doesn't attack, nor moves, nor doesn't perform any action that exposes it, it cannot be attacked with a ranged weapon. The defence is required only if the character is actually performing an action that would expose part of it out of the cover.</p>
<p>A <em>partial cover</em> is a high wall, large tree or column, three feet rock, and anything that could cover part of the body from the aim of the opponent.</p>
<p>A character <em>on the ground</em> is completely squashed, and can only use weapons and skill that might be used from this position (i.e. firearms).</p>
<p>A <em>precarious</em> cover is something providing just visual obfuscation, like a bush, or very partial cover, as a think tree trunk.</p>

<h3 id="attack-and-defence">Attack and Defence</h3>
<p>When an attack is declared, the target (or targets) can use a defence, either by using a specific combat skill or a <em>generic defence</em>.</p>
<p>The attacker and all the affected targets perform a Contest using their chosen skill as a base.</p>
<p>The attacker rolls and adds the value of the skill, as for any contest.</p>
<p>Determined the value for the attack roll, each defender performs its defence, rolling on the chosen defence skill.</p>
<p>A draw means that neither the attack nor the defence have been successful. A successful attack delivers a damage to the target. A successful defence might have an effect that depends on the used skill (it might also deliver a damage to the attacker).</p>
<h3 id="damage">Damage</h3>
<p>Damage is measured in <strong>DP</strong>, and is accounted as the established by the <strong>injury</strong> rule.</p>
<p>The damage delivered by a successful attack (or defence) is specified in the skill description under the <em>base damage</em> voice; usually, it's computed adding the success margin of the contest to some attribute based modifier.</p>
<p>The <em>dominance</em> of the skill, and eventually, of the used weapon is then added to the <em>base damage</em>; other modifiers (i.e. temporary magic incantation) might further be applied. The final total damage delivered is called <em>active damage</em> (<strong>AD</strong>).</p>
<p>The character receiving the damage computes its <em>damage mitigation</em> (<strong>DM</strong>) by adding <em>passive defences</em> that can affect the damage source (i.e. armours), and eventually <em>active defences</em> they might use.</p>
<p>Finally, the target character receives a number of <strong>DP</strong> = <strong>AD</strong> - <strong>DM</strong>. This damage is accounted as specified by the <a href="#BaM-m-injury-and-damage"><em>injury and damage</em></a> rule.</p>
<h3 id="critical-rolls">Critical Rolls</h3>
<p>A critical success doubles the value of the <em>success margin</em> when computing the <em>active damage</em>. When the damage roll doesn't involve the <strong>SM</strong> in the computation of the <strong>AD</strong>, a critical result adds 4 <strong>DP</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that some defences might generate a damage too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A critical failure indicates a failure even when the roll itself would indicate a success. For example, suppose an attacker with <strong>brawl</strong> 16 against a defender with <strong>archery</strong> 5. If the attacker rolls 3, which is a critical failure, the attack fails even if 16+3 would be above the archer's roll.</p>
<p>If both the attacker and defender roll a critical failure, the roll result (with the respective modifiers) is considered: critical failures on both sides elide each other.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat">Simplified Combat</h2>
<p>A first option for resolving combat scenes is that of simply using the combat skills in a normal skill contest.</p>
<p>This is an option for when a small group of opponents (normally, two to six) are facing each other with <em>compatible</em> fighting skills and weaponry. For example, you can use this method when two small bands are shooting at each other using the <strong>firearm</strong> skill, or involved in a fist fight and using <strong>brawl</strong>, or taking part in a little <strong>swordfight</strong> skirmish.</p>
<p>To perform combat as a <em>simplified combat</em>, all the participants must: 1. Agree to use the skills based on the same <em>root skill</em>. For example, a <em>simplified combat</em> can take place when all the characters use <strong>brawl</strong> or its derived skill <strong>full contact</strong>, but not if one of the characters is going to use <strong>archery</strong> or <strong>firearms</strong>. 2. Be actually able to use the skills involved. It's common knowledge that you don't bring a knife in a gunfight.</p>
<p>However, a character can use <strong>Generic Combat Skills</strong> skill to participate a fight this way, if they agree. For example, if everyone else is using <strong>swordfight</strong>, one character that happens to have a sword in its hands, but not knowing <strong>swordfight</strong>, could use <strong>Generic Combat Skills/slash</strong> instead, which acts as a sort of base for everyone trying to swing a weapon.</p>
<p>In the most extreme cases, a player might wish to go along with its companions, just using using an <strong>instinctive defence</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-duration">Fight Duration</h3>
<p>In terms of fight length, each contest lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of participants.</p>
<h3 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-resolution">Fight Resolution</h3>
<p>The fight is performed in the following order: 1. Everyone involved rolls on the selected skill. 1. To each roll, add the <strong>dominance</strong> of the skill chosen by every character, and if present, also the <strong>dominance</strong> of their weapon. 1. Order the scores from each party in decreasing values. 1. The top score in one party is matched against the top of the other; the second highest on one side is matched against the second highest on the other; and so on. 1. Considering the lowest score in each pair, add the <strong>dominance</strong> of the armour of the losing character, if present. 1. If the lower score is still lower after adding the armour <strong>dominance</strong>, the roll counts as a <em>victory</em> for the other character; otherwise, it is discarded. 1. The party realising the highest number of victories is the winning side.</p>
<p>In case the number of victories is the same on each side, repeat the procedure.</p>
<p>The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances and the number of critical successes/failures on each party. For example, a tavern brawl is hardly lethal, and a &quot;friendly&quot; swordfight (i.e. in order to subdue or dissuade an opponent) might simply end with the surrender of the losing party.</p>
<p>If you <em>want</em> to determine the result of winning or losing the fight with more precision, you <em>can</em> use the following rules.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat-injury">Injury Generation in basic combat (optional)</h2>
<p>If the fight is serious, the losing party will receive: * Two light wounds for each defeat. * Two serious wounds for each critical failure. * Two heavy wounds for each critical success in the winning party.</p>
<p>The winning party takes two serious injuries for each critical failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Critical results are evaluated taking each pair of rolls as a contest, <em>after</em> assigning the skill and weapon <em>dominance</em> on the initial roll, but before adding the armor <em>dominance</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat-damage-ranking">Damage Ranking</h3>
<p>The injuries are randomly distributed by a ranking (without draws) on either <strong>body</strong> or <strong>mind</strong>, depending on the type of fight in which the party was involved.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>List the wounds the receiving party will take, in increasing order of severity (light to heavy).</li>
<li>Assign as many wounds as necessary to match the <strong>disable level</strong> to the last ranked, starting from top (the lightest wounds first).</li>
<li>Continue with the second-last ranked, until all the wounds are assigned.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example: a party of four characters receive 6 light, 1 serious and 2 heavy wounds <em>physical wounds</em>; all the characters have DL/W=4. 1. the characters perform a draw-free ranking on <strong>body</strong>. 1. The last classified receives 4 light wounds and is knocked out. 1. the second-last receives 2 light, 1 serious and 1 heavy wound, and is knocked out; 1. the third-last receives the remaining heavy wound and is still in the fight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that the negative modifier for <strong>injury points</strong> applies to <em>any</em> action, including the fight resolution rolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat-fight-continuation">Fight Continuation</h3>
<p>If the characters so desire, they can continue fighting, repeating the <em>fight resolution</em> and the <em>damage ranking</em>, until there is someone standing.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-advanced-combat">Advanced Combat</h2>
<p>Advanced Combat is the most sophisticated combat sub-system; it expands the basic combat system by adding a set of sub-skills for each combat skill, called <em>manoeuvres</em>.</p>
<p><em>Manoeuvres</em> represent a special action a character can take while using the combat skill.</p>
<p>There are specific manoeuvres to attack and defend in each style, and each of them has different balances of difficulty of execution versus potential damage, or different effects on the reset of the combat. Some manoeuvres provide modifiers to subsequent moves, while some other generate damage also when defending.</p>
<h3 id="manoeuvre-types">Manoeuvre types</h3>
<p>Manoeuvres are divided into <em>attacks</em>, <em>defences</em> and <em>actions</em>. Attacks and defences represent a mores specific usages of the base combat skill as per the <em>base combat</em> rules; <em>actions</em> are other ways a combat skill can be employed.</p>
<p>For example, <strong>crouch</strong> is an action, and uses <strong>Full Contact</strong> as a normal skill, adding the eventual success margin to the next damage generated by an attack.</p>
<p>For example, the <strong>aim</strong> manoeuvre of the <strong>firearms</strong> style is neither an attack nor a defence: it allows to use the <strong>firearms</strong> skill as a normal skill that will success automatically, providing a modifier to the next attack.</p>
<h3 id="manoeuvre-modifier">Manoeuvre modifier</h3>
<p>Some manoeuvres are more difficult than others; some rely on brute force, others on finesse of execution. To reflect this, each manoeuvre can offer different modifiers to the various combat skill rolls.</p>
<p>In the advanced combat, the base skill modifier is ignored; only the manoeuvre modifier is used.</p>
<h3 id="manoeuvre-damage">Manoeuvre damage</h3>
<p>Each manoeuvre has a different damage coefficient, which depends on various factors. In the advanced combat, the <em>dominance</em> of the base combat skill is ignored when computing the damage, as the damage generated by the skill is already incorporated in the manoeuvre damage modifier.</p>
<p>However, eventual <em>dominance</em> generated by weapons and other effects (i.e. temporary spells) are still added to the <em>active damage</em>.</p>
<h3 id="diminishing-returns">Diminishing Returns</h3>
<p>Some manoeuvres get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly against the same target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has diminishing returns: your opponent will read your move, and will be able to better defend against the same attack. In those situations, you’ll want to be less predictable, and use other manoeuvres, or other styles altogether.</p>
<p>This factor is called <strong>diminishing return</strong> (<strong>DR</strong>) for a certain manoeuvre.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-m-combat-skills-and-styles">Combat Skills and Styles</h2>
<p>The skills used in combat go under the name of <em>combat styles</em>. Each style offers a collection of sub-skills called <em>manoeuvres</em>, which are used in the <em>advanced combat system</em>, and specify how a certain style is used during combat -- with the exception of <a href="#BaM-s-generic-combat">generic maneuveres</a>, which are proper skills on their own.</p>
<p>Advantages and perks can be targeted at skills only: either <em>combat styles</em> or <em>generic manoeuvres</em></p>
<p>For example, the advantage <a href="#BaM-a-expert"><strong>expert/skill</strong></a> can be targeted at all the <a href="#Brawl"><strong>brawl</strong></a> combat style or at the <a href="#BaM-s-generic-combat-disengage"><strong>disengage</strong></a> generic manoeuvre, but not at the <strong>punch</strong> manoeuvre of the <strong>brawl</strong> style.</p>
<p>The same combat style can also cover different kind of weapons, with some specific actions limited to some weapons. For example, Firearms is a combat style including rapid reload and sniping; however, rapid reload can be applied to pistols only, while sniping requires a precision rifle.</p>
<h3 id="combat-skills-cost">Combat Skills Cost</h3>
<p>Combat skills have a specific progression rule that differs from the other skills. Instead of following the cost table for simple/normal/hard skills, each level of a combat style costs the number of the level, plus a specific value that differ for each style.</p>
<p>For example, if the cost of <strong>brawl</strong> is 2. Bringing up brawl from 0 to 1 requires 3 CP (1+2), from 6 to 7 it requires 9 CP (2+7), and from 17 to 18 it requires 20 CP.</p>
<h2 id="BaM-s-generic-combat-skills">Generic Combat Skills</h2>
<p>The skills in this sections are combat skills not related with any <em>combat style</em>.</p>
<p>They differ from normal manoeuvres in the fact that they don’t belong to any style, and as proper skills, they can be learned independently, and targeted by advantages and perks.</p>

<p>Concentration is a simple mind-oriented fighting style, which can be seamlessly integrated in a traditional melee fight. It covers the role of the “default” combat style for mental combat, analogous to brawl for physical combat. In a world where mental fight is a thing, everyone should be able to mind meld, like everyone is able to brawl in physical worlds.</p>
<p>While other fighting styles in the manual are realistic, this requires a setting specifically supporting mind powers. However, the style is suitable for sci-fi settings to handle fights between AIs, robots, hackers and so on, with low-resolution.</p>

<p>An advanced version and extension of Brawl. While still not being a full-fledged martial art, it’s a style of combat that requires dedication, and if professionally trained, can be quite effective even against more famous martial arts.</p>
<p>A character using Full Contact can use all the manoeuvres from <em>Brawl</em> under <em>Full Contact</em> instead (whichever has the higher level).</p>
<p>All damage from <em>full contact</em> is of <strong>blunt</strong> type, unless differently specified.</p>
<p>A well trained full-contact fighter is as dangerous as an armed opponent. A character using Full Contact can use an extra manoeuvre from this style each turn.</p>

<p>Fighting with knives and very short swords has different mechanics than the ones used when wielding a longer blade. Basically, it’s like having a fist armed with a single fang. While the weapon themselves could be less effective than longer ones, the style itself can be extremely effective in every scenario. Knife fighting is particularly adequate for characters with a high dexterity. The number of manoeuvres the character can use per round depends on the level of Kinfe Fight:</p>

<p>Swordfight is the simplest discipline for handling traditional melee weapons. Despite the name, it’s not limited to swords, as it can be used also with maces, flails, shields and so on.</p>
<p>The style doesn’t differentiate between different kind of weapons as far as special effect and damage is concerned. To take advantage of the specificities of each weapon, a character can learn the specific style.</p>
<h3 id="two-handed-weapons">Two-handed weapons</h3>
<p>This style can be used with large two-handed swords, maces and hammers as well; they prevent the usage of a shield (and any manoeuvre related requiring it), but give a <strong>DP</strong> modifier of +3.</p>
<p>The number of manoeuvres the character can use per round depends on the level of Sword Fight:</p>

<p>Weapons are either used unskilfully, using any one of the Generic Combat Skills, or through the appropriate combat style. The default damage (and often, damage type) caused by the weapon is already accounted for in the combat style; for example, Firearms/shoot causes a higher damage than Brawl/punch because guns are more lethal than bare hands. However, some special weapon (i.e. magic swords, experimental rifles etc.) might give their wielder a modifier either to the attack or defence rolls, or solely to the damage caused once a hit is scored. In the following table, the weight is the typical weight of for the given type of weapon, the range either the throwing distance or the range of the projectiles, in feet, and the cost is an indicative cost for a normal weapon of that kind.</p>

<h2 id="BaM-apx-conflict-table">Conflict Table</h2>
<p>This table shows how likely is to win, lose or achieve a draw on a contest roll, given a certain difference in the base.</p>
<p>Suppose the base is the same for both characters; the difference of the bases is zero. The probability to win or lose is the same, 45%, and there is a 10% probability to roll a draw.</p>
<p>If a character rolls on a base 10, and the other has a base 13, the difference is 3. The character with the base 10, reads its chances on the -3 row, and the other uses the row number 3. In this case the advantage character has 70% chance to win, 22% to lose and 8% to achieve a draw; the position of the other character is reversed.</p>

<p>Consider: with a -3 modifier, you have only 1 chance over five to win -- be very cautious fighting characters with higher bases than you.</p>
