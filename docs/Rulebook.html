<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>SIRPAS stands for “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”. It’s a
generic, modular and extensible table-top RPG system, that aims to be as
simple as needed and become as complex as you wish.</p>
<p>SIRPAS is organized in the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>rulebook</strong> (what you’re reading now): bare-bone
description of how the system works. There isn’t any list of skills,
attributes, or specific rendering of the rules in practice. At times
we’ll use some well known skill that may be found in any generic RPG
(e.g. <em>strength</em> or <em>climbing</em>) to make some example of
how the rules work, but nothing more.</li>
<li>The <strong>base module</strong>: a basic implementation of the
rules, which describes very generic attributes, skills, damage sources
and other concrete aspect of the system, that should be general enough
to be applied to most if not all the RPG settings you may come up
with.</li>
<li>Additional <strong>modules</strong>: Extension of the base system
(which may enrich it or change it if necessary), particularly adequate
to describe some specific world or setting for your adventures.</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need is the <strong>base module</strong>. The system will
often refer to the rules in this rulebook, so you will need to know
them, but you don’t need to know them <em>upfront</em>. The <strong>base
module</strong> will briefly explain the relevant rules when possible or
point at this rulebook when necessary. You may wish to read this book in
advance, skim over it, or just ignore it until you feel the need to read
some portions of it following the <strong>base module</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experts</strong>: Feel free to skip the rest of this
introduction. The only thing an expert need to know about is that SIRPAS
is generic (setting-less), skill-based, using d6 only (and mostly 3d6)
with a fully modular system architecture. Detailed sub-system can be
used or ignored, depending on the mood of the night, while still having
your character set-up count. Also, all the systems are inter-playable:
you could bring a character from a Cthulu-esque campaign in a cyberpunk
settings, and the rules will work just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-sirpas">What is SIRPAS?</h2>
<p>SIRPAS is a “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking <em>adventures</em> here: a role playing session
that can spawn for a casual night with friends, or with the family, or
with strangers met at a gaming club. Systems thought for Role Playing
Games are (usually) complex enough for you to invest lots of time in
creating your characters, play through multiple sessions and use some
time off to sort your past games out to get fun out of them.</p>
<p>Some may say that’s actually part of the fun itself. If you like the
streamlined experience of Sirpas gameplay, you can play adventures
spawning multiple sessions, or multiple adventures with the same
characters, in the same world (this is often referred as
<em>campaign</em>).</p>
<p>But you don’t need to. The idea is having as little commitment as
necessary to get playing, and then, pour in as much commitment as you
want if you like it.</p>
<h2 id="a-system-for-everyone">A system for everyone</h2>
<p>Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran
players.</p>
<p>Who reads this manual and has never heard about role playing games
before will encounter many new terms that have a special meaning in RPG,
as <em>session</em>, <em>adventure</em>, <em>campaign</em>,
<em>world</em>, <em>setting</em>, <em>character</em>, etc. Also, they
might need on how to prepare, organize, manage, or even behave during a
session. This is important, but it is not covered in this manual. This
rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible; all the concepts
commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger Internet.</p>
<p>However, to help the beginners getting on RPG with Sirpas, depending
on the media you’re reading the rulebook, we will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>provide hyperlink to the description of the term.</li>
<li>highlighting terms with special meaning in RPG. A fast Internet
search for “RPG” and the highlighted word will bring you to the
description of the term.</li>
<li>Add a box named “For Beginners” near the relevant terms, that
experienced readers can skip.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="feel-of-the-system">Feel of the system</h2>
<p>Sirpas has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic: rules are meant to be applicable in any settings you can
come up with. More on that later.</li>
<li>Modular: Sirpas has a lean set of rules called <strong>Base
System</strong>. The base system is generic enough to support any world
setting and playing style. On this base system, additional rules (called
<strong>modules</strong>) can be attached to better fit your game world.
Want a system to perform mind fights between Asimov inspired psionic
super-humans? We got you. Want a be a gunslinger involved in
western-styled show downs? That can be done too. A wizard casting magic
spells? No problem. An occultist summoning extra-dimensional entities?
That’s fine. The system is even flexible enough to merge multiple styles
of magic, melee combats, large scale fights and ranged missile firing in
the same session. Yes, you can bring a bow (or a knife) in a
gunfight.</li>
<li>Extensible: Other than designing your own additional modules, you
can also modify the base system to fit your need. For example, there
base system has two main attributes called <strong>Body</strong> and
<strong>Mind</strong>; if you want to play as an AI in a virtual world,
you may replace <strong>Body</strong> with <strong>MIPS</strong>
(millions of operation per second), and use <strong>Mind</strong> as an
expression of the quality of your O.S. and software. The rest of the
base system will still stand and be mostly useful for you to play
with.</li>
<li>Role-play oriented: the system emphasizes the build-up of the
character; both the composition of its skill set in the adventure world,
and the makeup of its personality, play a primary role in how the rules
unfold.</li>
<li>Simple as you want: the base system has differently detailed rules
to resolve game situations. For example, combat or any type of
confrontation between two opposing parties could be resolved with a
single throw of a few dices (Risk! style), or with the detail of a
Warhammer miniature replica battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the system is based on multiple rolls of a standard dice with 6
face; however, different modules support other kind of dices, if that’s
the vibe you want for your game.</p>
<h2 id="play-any-world">Play Any World</h2>
<p>Sirpas is a generic role playing system, that doesn’t presume
anything on the setting of your adventures. The system applies whatever
your players might want to play; as normal people struggling to survive
in a post-apocalyptic world, as wizards and knights in a high fantasy
setting, as cyborgs in a SF plot, or even as AIs in a virtual
reality.</p>
<h2 id="combatless-adventures">Combatless Adventures</h2>
<p>In most RPG settings, combat is a central part of the game action, if
not the absolute protagonist. This leads to RPG systems being usually
structured around the combat mechanics, and gaming sessions being mainly
occupied by detailing combat actions.</p>
<p>Sirpas works the other way around: the combat system is simply the
specialization of the general system. As such, is possible to run
adventures or entire campaign devoid of “combat”, and focusing either on
other kind of contest (as i.e. skill battles in virtual worlds), or in
other aspects of the role playing altogether.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a police drama as a RPG setting. While
gunfights might play an important part in the campaign, the very nature
of a gunfight doesn’t translate into interesting RPG mechanics, while
more interesting actions as sword fights or martial art fights might not
fit the setting.</p>
<p>As such, Sirpas focuses on a more differentiated gameplay, which can
be as combat-intensive or combat-devoid as needed.</p>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<p>In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that
define a characters. They are divided in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#attributes">Attributes</a>: important aspect of the
character on which many other mechanics depend. For example
<em>body</em>, <em>strength</em>, or <em>spirit</em> could be attributes
in many game worlds. <strong>Skills</strong> are special
<strong>attributes</strong> used to perform specific actions, as
<em>hacking</em>, <em>lock picking</em>, <em>running</em>,
<em>climbing</em> etc.</li>
<li><a href="#statuses">Statuses</a>: values that vary fluidly during an
adventure; for example, to keep track of the current health of a
character you can look at its <strong>injury points</strong>.</li>
<li><a href="#vantages">Vantages</a>: <strong>advantages</strong> or
<strong>disadvantages</strong> targeting either the rules as a whole or
improving a specific attribute in some way. For example, some advantages
allows you to throw more die in some situation, others may reduce the
difficulty of actions performed with a certain skill.</li>
<li><a href="#backgrounds">Backgrounds</a>: distinctive traits setting
the character apart from the background people in the setting; for
example, being “famous” or “outlaw”. They have an impact in the
adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly some checks,
providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes describe a character as succinctly as possible. They are
organized in a hierarchy. Higher level attributes are more
<em>generic</em>: they describe general aspects of your character. The
lower you descend in the hierarchy, the more detailed the attribute
become. At the bottom of the hierarchy we find <strong>skills</strong>,
that are attributes dedicated to performing specific actions.</p>
<p>Attributes and skills are normally expressed as a value between 3 and
18, which is the range of value that can be expressed by summing the
result of a 3d6 dice throw. A value of 3 represents the minimum skill
level, or characteristic, that a character could have to be still
considered minimally functional in the game world — a value below 3
would indicate a sub-normal characteristic. A value of 18 would
represent the apex for the game environment, and the values between 10
and 12 would be the most common across the reference population.</p>
<p>The scaling would be relative to the game setting. For example, if
playing a campaign where the characters are Greek or Norse gods, a value
of 3 on any statistic would probably express a level of proficiency far
superior to that of any human.</p>
<p>Notice that the scaling is not linear: it follows the probability
distribution of the 3d6 dice throw. For example, a character with
strength 12 is just marginally stronger than one with strength 11, but
one with strength 18 is in a totally different league than one with
strength 17. Similarly, characters with health 10 and 11 have a very
similar constitution, but one with health 3 will be much weaker than one
with health 4.</p>
<p>Modules can introduce different range and scaling for some or all the
attributes; for example, in a vampire society an attribute like
<strong>Vampire Speed</strong> (shortened as <strong>VS</strong>) could
be measured as a linear scale in a 0-99 range, where a
<strong>VS</strong>0 is as fast as the fastest human, with one point of
difference having the same value whether the <strong>VS</strong> is 0 or
99.</p>
<h3 id="most-specific-attribute">Most specific attribute</h3>
<p>As attributes are ordered in a hierarchy, the base of each of them
indicating their parent, when a character needs to perform an action for
which a specific attribute is not provided by the game module in use,
the Game Master will chose the best approximation possible.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose the game module provides the attributes
<strong>charisma</strong>, base for <strong>elegance</strong>, which is
base for <strong>etiquette</strong>. If the character needs to perform a
correct ballroom introduction, <strong>etiquette</strong> will be
chosen; to determine how well they dance (provided there isn’t a
<strong>dance</strong> skill available), <strong>elegance</strong> will
be next in the line, and to determine the impression left with some
chit-chat after the dance, <strong>charisma</strong> will be used.</p>
<h3 id="base-value">Base value</h3>
<p>In general, it’s common for higher level attributes to form the
<strong>base</strong> of the lower level ones, which are said to be
their <strong>dependent</strong> attributes. Every dependent attribute
has a <strong>base value</strong>, a default value that depends on the
current value of its base.</p>
<p>Whenever a base attribute improves for any reason, all the dependents
improve as well. Of course, improving attributes that form the base of
many others is typically more difficult than improving the
dependents.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that in a game world the attribute <strong>Arm
Wrestling (AW)</strong> based on for <strong>Strength (S)</strong>. A
character that has never learned any specific arm wrestling trick has
the same value in <strong>AW</strong> and <strong>S</strong>. If
<strong>S</strong> is 10, <strong>AW</strong> is 10 as well. If the
character trains on <strong>AW</strong>, it may get an extra point and
have <strong>S</strong>=10, <strong>AW</strong>= <strong>S</strong>+1
=11. If the character then trains on general <strong>S</strong> (which
is harder than specialize in <strong>AW</strong>), so that its
<strong>S</strong>=11, its <strong>AW</strong> grows too, as now
<strong>AW</strong> = <strong>S</strong>+1 = 12.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all the attributes have bases; those at the top of the hierarchy,
even some skill that cannot be classified or inherit any base value are
called <strong>baseless</strong>, and their default value is 0 unless
differently specified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="base-modifiers">Base Modifiers</h3>
<p>In some situation, instead of using an attribute as a direct base,
the system requires to use a <em>modifier</em> that depends on the value
of the base. Those are called <strong>base modifiers</strong>.</p>
<p>This happens when some attributes are hard to train, and so they need
to be learned almost from scratch, but some other attribute may give a
minor advantage. For example learning <strong>lores</strong> requires
studying them; there is no way around actually opening the books (or any
equivalent media). However, a high <strong>intelligence</strong> may
help both to memorize and grasp some aspect or detail that would pass
unnoticed by most. In such cases, the <strong>intelligence</strong>
cannot be a direct base for <strong>lores</strong>, but could well
provide a base modifier.</p>
<p>The following table indicates the <strong>base modifier</strong>
associated with the value of the base attribute.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Attribute</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Modifier</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">3-5</td>

</table>
<p>To indicate that the modifier of an attribute is base for another,
the attribute is prefixed with a lower case “<strong>m</strong>”. For
example, Suppose a skill like <strong>swimming</strong> is based on the
modifier of an attribute called <strong>Dex</strong>. The base of
<strong>swimming</strong> will be then expressed not as
<strong>Dex</strong>, but as m<strong>Dex</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="type-or-base-values">Type or base values</h3>
<p>While attributes are organized in a hierarchy, the hierarchy is not
necessarily top-to-bottom. Some attributes may have multiple bases, or
more complex way to determine their default value.</p>
<p>For example, consider a magic system where the <strong>mana
pool</strong> (amount of magic power that can be spent before resting)
depends on the <strong>affinity</strong> to a certain element. The
system has <strong>affinity</strong>/<em>element</em> attributes for
<em>earth</em>, <em>air</em>, <em>water</em> and <em>fire</em>, which
play different roles at different times, but the <strong>mana
pool</strong> is based on the <em>highest of them</em>. Or, it may have
their average, or their sum as a base. In this case, <strong>mana
pool</strong> is <em>dependent</em> of all of the
<strong>affinity</strong> attributes, which are all its base, but the
actual <strong>base value</strong> may be a formula.</p>
<p>There are different type of bases, expressed as a formula in
parenthesis after the dependent attribute name in their formal
definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baseless: the attribute has no base. This is expressed by not having
any value in parenthesis after the name.</li>
<li>Fixed base: (N) where N is a number. N is the <strong>base
value</strong> for that attribute.</li>
<li>Direct Base: expressed as (<strong>X</strong>) where
<strong>X</strong> is the official abbreviation of the base. the
attribute has the value of <strong>X</strong> as its <strong>base
value</strong>.</li>
<li>Modifier Base: (m<strong>X</strong>). The <strong>base
value</strong> is the <em>modifier</em> of the attribute X.</li>
<li>Base Portion: (<strong>X</strong>/N). The <strong>base
value</strong> is a portion N of the base attribute. Typically N is 2, 3
or 4 (the <strong>base value</strong> being half, a third or a fourth of
that of the base attribute). Rounding is always down.</li>
<li>Average Base: (avg <strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>,…). The
<strong>base value</strong> is the average of the listed values.</li>
<li>Choice Base: (<strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong>). The
<strong>base value</strong> is the best between the options listed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="training-attributes">Training attributes</h3>
<p>Any permanent alteration to an attribute is known as “training”.
Generally, that means increasing its value, but a training can be
negative (i.e. because of an accident producing a permanent disadvantage
or a long-lasting curse).</p>
<p>The most common way to improve an attribute is spending a resource
generated by going through various in-games experiences, called
<strong>training tokens</strong> (<strong>TT</strong>).</p>
<p>As attributes are hierarchical, and training base attributes is
harder than derived ones, <strong>TT</strong>s can only be applied to
the attribute of a specific level, or they can be exchanged with 2
<strong>TT</strong>s of the lower level.</p>
<p>In general, the hierarchy level of the <strong>TT</strong> is
specified as a number, so that <strong>TT</strong>/1 is a train token
for the top tier attributes, <strong>TT</strong>/2 is one for the
attributes directly derived from them etc; however, every module can
declare different attribute categories and hierarchies, that aren’t
necessarily following the base value chains.</p>
<p>For example, if a module declares a hierarchy of attributes as</p>
<pre><code>Primary -&gt; Generic -&gt; Hard Skills -&gt; Easy Skills</code></pre>
<p>a <strong>TT</strong>/Primary can be exchanged for 2
<strong>TT</strong>/Generic, 4 <strong>TT</strong>/Hard, or 8
<strong>TT</strong>/Easy.</p>
<p>It is not possible to exchange multiple lower level tokens for a
higher level one: <strong>TT</strong>s represent formative experiences
the characters have gone through during a game session, and to change
something at the very base if their essence, they must have faced
impressive events; a large number of small experiences won’t cut it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that, usually, base skills will have more than 2 dependents;
this means that exchanging a higher level token for 2 lower ones is
usually not worth, unless the character really need some differently
based lower level attribute to be improved as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="training-pre-requisites">Training pre-requisites</h4>
<p>Some attributes may have pre-requisites for training. They can be
either:</p>
<ul>
<li>not accessible until one or more other attributes have reached a
certain level, or</li>
<li>be capped to the current level of another attribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in a Sci-fi campaign with psionic powers, the skill
<strong>natural mentalism</strong> may be capped to the current value of
<strong>mental power</strong>, and <strong>mind melding</strong> could
be inaccessible until <strong>mental power</strong> reaches at least
level 10.</p>
<p>Eventual prerequisites are declared in the attribute description.</p>
<h3 id="in-world-training-optional">In-world training (optional)</h3>
<p>The Game Master or the modules may require additional conditions to
be able to train attributes, other than having the necessary
<strong>TT</strong>. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an adequate trainer available for teaching;</li>
<li>Undertake a specific ritual at a specific time/location;</li>
<li>Having the necessary cyber implants available;</li>
<li>Spending a sensible time in training;</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s totally plausible for the character to just improve as a matter
of spending the <strong>TT</strong>, as the tokens represent an amount
of experience that <em>per se</em>, for the mere fact of being acquired,
in the general case should grant an improvement of their abilities.</p>
<p>But in some scenarios, the <strong>TT</strong> may represent a lived
experience that needs to be formalized, a token of <em>being ready</em>
to take the step of the formal training.</p>
<h3 id="cascade-attributes">Cascade Attributes</h3>
<p>Cascade attributes are attributes that can be be trained multiple
times, each of them representing a single attempt in repeated
checks.</p>
<p>For example, some combat skills can be used only once per combat
turn. To use them multiple times in a turn, a second version of the same
skill must be trained.</p>
<p>In the player sheet, they will be indicated as “Composite skill / 1”,
“Composite Skill / 2” and so on. If the composite skill is specialized,
it will be indicated as “Skill/specialization / 1”,
“Skill/specialization / 2” and so on.</p>
<p>Composite attributes are still targeted as a single one by
attribute-targeting advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>For example, if “Active Mitigation” is a combat specialized and
composite attribute, and <strong>Swordfight</strong> is a combat style,
the advantage <strong>Expert / Active Mitigation / Swordfight</strong>
will cover all the versions of <strong>Active Mitigation /
Swordfight</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="temporary-attribute-variations">Temporary attribute
variations</h3>
<p>Normally, the value of dependent attributes is computed only when the
base attribute changes definitively, through a means that improves (or
reduces it) permanently. In practice, this happens every few hours of
uninterrupted game.</p>
<p>However, it’s possible that an attribute is temporarily altered by
various means; for example by magic, drugs or boosts to cyber
implants.</p>
<p>If the attribute is a base for many others, it may be difficult to
keep track of the temporary changes to its dependents. To avoid
excessive burden to the game play, temporary attribute variations are
applied to its dependents only if the attribute is their <strong>direct
base</strong>.</p>
<p>Every other case, that is, every case in which a dependent has a
complex formula to determine its base value, is considered as if the
value of its base (or bases) cannot be immediately applied.</p>
<p>For example, an arm wrestler can feel a temporary boost or loss of
strength right away. This will be expressed as the attribute <strong>arm
wrestling</strong> having the direct base value of <em>strength</em>,
expressed as “(<strong>S</strong>)”. Conversely, if
<strong>lore</strong> has a base value expressed as
“(m<strong>I</strong>)” where <strong>I</strong> stands for
<strong>intelligence</strong>, and m<strong>I</strong> is the
<strong>intelligence</strong> modifier, this means that it takes some
effort to learn lores even for a very intelligent character, and as
such, a temporary improvement of <strong>intelligence</strong> won’t be
transferred to <strong>lore</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="statuses-and-status-points">Statuses and status points</h1>
<p>Characters will sustain negative effects in pools called
<em>statuses</em>. Most statuses are binary, i.e. on or off. For
example, a character may be <em>asleep</em> or <em>awake</em>: its
“being awake” status may be on/off.</p>
<p>Some statuses have numeric values, and the character will be
negatively affected if the number increases. For example, the number of
<a href="#wounds">injury points</a>: the higher, the worse.</p>
<p>Finally, there are statuses that start at a certain maximum level,
and as the characters use their skills, they are used up. This statuses
are called <em>pools</em>, and various modules and sub-systems can
define different pools for specific usages. For example, a magic system
may define a <em>mana pool</em>, which determines how many spells a
character can cast.</p>
<h1 id="vantages">Vantages</h1>
<p><strong>Vantages</strong> special conditions that apply to the
character in general or to a specific attribute or set of attribute in
particular, and that have a direct effect on some game mechanics. They
are called <strong>advantages</strong> if positive and
<strong>disadvantages</strong> if negative.</p>
<p>For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to
automatically win a draw once a day. Others may give you extra die to
throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra point to
all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all
<em>easy skill checks</em> based on a certain attribute. Others may
reduce the difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one
level, so that i.e. a skill called <strong>climbing</strong> on
<em>easy</em> targets becomes trivial, on <em>normal</em> targets it
becomes <em>easy</em> and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong> are negative
<strong>vantages</strong>. A character might be given disadvantages
temporarily or permanently, because of what happened during previous
adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages have negative CP
costs, a player can chose to get certain disadvantages in order to gain
<strong>training tokens</strong> to be spent elsewhere, in other
statistics.</p>
<p>While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have
different levels. For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival
Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level of all survival
checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra
reduced difficulty level.</p>
<p>In that case, the cost to be paid (or refund obtained) of each level
is the base cost plus the level acquired.</p>
<p>For example, suppose an advantage called <strong>graceful</strong>
can be acquired at levels 1 to 3, each level making the advantage
stronger. The cost indicated in the description is 2
<strong>TT</strong>/<em>Primary</em> (training tokens of type
<em>primary</em>). To buy level 1, the players must spend 2 + 1 = 3
tokens; level 2 costs 2 + 2 = 4, and level 3 2 + 3 = 5 tokens. This
means that if players wants to get <strong>graceful</strong>/3 from
scratch, they must use 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 <em>primary</em> tokens.</p>
<p>The tokens refunded when acquiring (willfully) a disadvantage follow
the same rule, granting a number of tokens equal to the indicated base
cost plus the level the players are willing to take, cumulated. So, if a
disadvantage called <strong>clumsy</strong> has base “cost” 2
<strong>TT</strong>/<em>Primary</em> and can be acquired with level 1 to
3, players giving <strong>clumsy</strong>/3 to their character will
receive 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 <strong>TT</strong>/<em>Primary</em> to be spent
on something else.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-prerequisites">Advantage prerequisites</h3>
<p>Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in
order to be acquired. For example, they could require having already
acquired another advantage, or having a certain statistic at a minimum
set score.</p>
<h3 id="other-limitations-optional">Other limitations (optional)</h3>
<p>The GM may allow to get a certain number of advantages and/or
disadvantages to be taken at character creation, or may allow to get
some of them later on if that’s fitting for the setting. For example, in
a cyberpunk setting, many advantages may be granted through body
implants, which may be be bought under certain conditions.</p>
<h2 id="premium-advantages">Premium advantages</h2>
<p>In some cases, a character can receive an advantage as a reward for
completing a certain task. Advantages can be gained by magic,
e.g. blessings, or physical conditions, e.g. receiving a cybernetic
implant by the government as a reward for being enlisted in a special
corp.</p>
<p>Whenever an advantage is a acquired as a reward, that require
spending the front cost in <strong>TT</strong>s</p>
<h2 id="removing-advantages">Removing advantages</h2>
<p>It is possible to remove advantages that have become obsolete. If the
player so wishes, it can remove an advantage and recover half its
nominal cost in <strong>TT</strong>s (rounded up). This doesn’t include
premium advantages, that is, advantages received as rewards for in-game
deeds.</p>
<h2 id="penalty-disadvantages">Penalty disadvantages</h2>
<p>In some cases, a character can receive a disadvantage unwillingly.
This may be caused by magic, e.g. curses, or physical conditions, e.g. a
necessary cybernetic component of their body becoming unserviceable or
being hijacked by a malignant hacker.</p>
<p>Whenever a disadvantage is a acquired as a penalty, that doesn’t give
any additional <strong>TT</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="removing-disadvantages">Removing disadvantages</h2>
<p>It is possible to remove disadvantages that the players have
willfully applied on their character. This can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>paying back double the cost of the disadvantage in equivalent
<strong>Training Tokens</strong>, or</li>
<li>by performing particularly worthy tasks in game, aimed directly at
reducing or removing the disadvantage. For example, a player may save a
famous cybernetic scientist in exchange for his help removing a
defective cyber implant. This can remove also <em>penalty
disadvantages</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the disadvantage has levels, each level needs to be removed
separately: it’s necessary to pay double the tokens received by
acquiring each level, one by one, before being able to remove the
disadvantage completely.</p>
<p>For example, if a <strong>clumsy</strong>/3 disadvantage, with base
cost 2 <strong>TT</strong>/<em>Primary</em> granted 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
tokens, to remove it players must pay 24
<strong>TT</strong>/<em>Primary</em>.</p>
<h2 id="conflicting-vantages">Conflicting vantages</h2>
<p>Characters cannot acquire advantages having opposite effects to
disadvantages they own, and the other way around, they cannot acquire
disadvantages conflicting with advantages they already own.</p>
<p>If a game situation applies a <em>premium advantage</em> or a
<em>penalty disadvantage</em> to a character already having a
conflicting vantage, that one is removed instead.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the advantage <strong>graceful</strong> has
the opposite disadvantage called <strong>clumsy</strong>: it acts on the
same skills and checks, but the first gives a bonus while the second
inflicts an opposite penalty. In this situation, if a character having
<strong>graceful</strong> is hit by <strong>clumsy</strong> because of
the effect of a curse, <strong>graceful</strong> is removed instead.</p>
<p>If the conflicting advantages are leveled, the character is left with
the larger of the two, reduced of the value of the other. For example,
if a character with <strong>clumsy</strong>/1 receives a blessing that
would grant <strong>graceful</strong>/3, then
<strong>graceful</strong>/2 is applied instead.</p>
<p>This happens also if the to statistics are not exactly specular, but
just acting in opposite direction on the same skills or checks. For
example, if <strong>expert</strong> reduces the natural penalty of
<em>normal</em>, <em>hard</em> and <em>very hard</em> checks for a
certain skill while <strong>novice</strong> increases the penalty of
<em>trivial</em> checks only, they are still considered conflicting
under this rule. However, they would not be considered conflicting if
they affect different skills.</p>
<h2 id="skill-specific-disadvantages">Skill-specific disadvantages</h2>
<p>Some disadvantage can target specific skills and checks, making them
harder or weaker for the character afflicted by it.</p>
<p>In general, the <strong>GM</strong> should allow players to acquire
the disadvantage in exchange for tokens only if it’s actually relevant
for them:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a skill that is very commonly used by everyone in-world, as a
hacking skill on a AI or cyberpunk setting, or a fist fighting skill in
a fantasy world.</li>
<li>On a skill that is relevant for the in-world occupation of the
player, as for example thievery skills for thieves and spies, healing
skills for healers and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea here is that of not giving “free upgrades” for the players
to use without consequences.</p>
<p>This doesn’t <em>necessarily</em> apply to <em>penalty
disadvantages</em>, that characters may be subject to because of
something happening during their adventure. For example, a character may
receive a light curse that afflicts a specific skill by design, which
may or may not be relevant for the character.</p>
<h1 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h1>
<p>Backgrounds are generic advantages and disadvantages giving deeper
customization to characters in the game world.</p>
<p>Whatever in makes the character stand out with respect to the vast
population is considered a <em>background</em>.</p>
<p>Some backgrounds may be generally advantageous for the character,
while others might be generally detrimental.</p>
<p>For example, being famous, of noble origins, having a career in a
peculiar field as university professor, being an outlaw, a member of an
ostracized religious sect or having an uncommon phobia are all
<em>backgrounds</em>. While being famous seems more desirable than being
an outlaw, in some game situations it may be preferable to be the latter
than the former.</p>
<p>For this reason, there isn’t a net distinction between positive and
negative backgrounds, and they all have a positive cost in
<strong>training tokens</strong> to be spent at character creation. It
is also possible to receive the backgrounds as a consequence of
adventuring; for example, one can certainly become an outlaw during the
course of an adventure; nobles can lose their titles, university
professors can lose their positions and phobias can be cured, but
differently from <em>vantages</em>, <em>backgrounds</em> can only be
removed as a consequence of gameplay.</p>
<h2 id="effect-on-the-game">Effect on the game</h2>
<p>Backgrounds can and usually will have an influence in how the
adventure plays, but they don’t have a direct effect on the rules; that
what’s vantages are for. However, some of them may have some indirect
effect on the rules in some specific situation.</p>
<p>For example, being a <strong>criminal boss</strong> doesn’t give the
character a direct upgrade or downgrade in any skill check; it is meant
to direct the character’s adventure in a certain direction, and make
clearer how they will react when facing criminality or law enforcement,
but in some cases the <strong>GM</strong> may apply a discretional bonus
or penalty on some check, i.e. when trying to
<strong>intimidate</strong> a gang member.</p>
<h2 id="backgrounds-are-not-physical">Backgrounds are not physical</h2>
<p>Physical characteristics are never to be considered backgrounds; this
because any physically apparent characteristic would either have an
effect on attributes or be severely limiting on the gameplay. For
example, the ability to <strong>persuade</strong> already takes into
account the attractiveness of a character. Conversely, a physical
disability is difficult to translate into gameplay, while a low
attribute number can better represent it.</p>
<h1 id="checks">Checks</h1>
<p>A check consists of throwing dices and verify if the result is
successful. Checks are the nuts and bolts of SIRPAS. Practically every
action that might succeed or fail requires performing a successful
check. There are different kind of checks that apply to different
situations, but in general, a check consists in beating some high point
score summing a 3d6 with the value of the statistics on which the check
is performed.</p>
<h2 id="simple-check">Simple check</h2>
<p>A <em>simple check</em> is a test for the character to be able to
perform a certain action, which requires a certain
<strong>skill</strong> to be employed. For example, to verify if the
character can land safely after jumping down from a height, it must pass
a <em>simple check</em> on a skill having that purpose (for example
<em>acrobatics</em>).</p>
<p>The skill descriptions indicate which actions are covered by each of
them. When a character wants to perform an action not covered by a
specific skill, one of its generic attributes are used instead; the Game
Master decide which is the most adequate one. For example, if a
character is trying to extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is
a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, the Game Master
might ask to pass a <em>simple check</em> on its <em>strength</em>.</p>
<p>To <em>perform</em> a <strong>simple check</strong> means to throw
three dice (or a different number, where the rules specify it) and sum
the result of the rolled dice to the value of the employed skill or
attribute. The rules might specify other modifiers to be applied to
specific checks; for example being injured applies a penalty to any
check.</p>
<p>The sole result of the dice rolls is called <strong>natural
result</strong>, while the grand total of the <strong>natural
result</strong>, skill or attribute value and modifiers is called
<em>check result</em> (<strong>CR</strong>). To win (or <em>pass</em>) a
<strong>simple check</strong>, the <strong>check result</strong> must be
above a score called <em>success level</em> (<strong>SL</strong>) that
depends on the difficulty of the action, according with the following
table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Difficulty</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Success Level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Trivial</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Easy</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">18</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Normal</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">21</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Difficult</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">24</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Hard</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">27</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Very Hard</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">29</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Skill descriptions will reference this table to specify which kind
off attempt are to considered, easy, normal, hard and so on. When the
skill description doesn’t specify it, the Game Master can assign a
difficulty modifier depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Some skills may be performed only against a <strong>normal</strong>
success level, but assign an additional bonus or penalty depending on
the situation. For example, trying to perform an acrobatic action while
jumping from high may inflict a penalty that increases in proportion to
the height of the jump.</p>
<h3 id="success-margin">Success Margin</h3>
<p>The difference between the <strong>check result</strong> and the
<strong>success level</strong> is called <strong>Success Margin</strong>
(<strong>SM</strong>). The <strong>SM</strong> is 0 or above on success,
and less than 0 on failure.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-results">Automatic Results</h3>
<p>In a <strong>simple check</strong>, When a <em>natural 18</em> is
scored, and if the action is of <em>normal</em> difficulty or easier,
the <em>simple check</em> is automatically passed, regardless the
<em>check result</em> being actually above the required
<strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p>When a <em>natural 3</em> is scored, and if the action is of
<em>normal</em> difficulty or harder, the <em>simple check</em>
automatically fails, regardless the <em>check result</em> being actually
below the required <strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> <em>easy</em> actions have an
<em>automatic success</em> with a <em>natural 17</em> or better and
<em>very easy</em> actions with a <em>natural 16</em> or better.
<em>Hard</em> actions fail automatically with a <em>natural 4</em> or
worse, and <em>very hard</em> actions with a <em>natural 5</em> or
worse.</p>
<p>An <strong>automatic result</strong> is considered also a
<strong>critical success</strong> or <strong>critical
failure</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-attempts">Repeated Attempts</h2>
<p>In some situation, it is possible to repeat a failed attempt soon
after the first try, either by the same character or by another one in
the same group.</p>
<p>For example, picking a lock (when no one is around and there aren’t
time constraints) can be repeated indefinitely by every member that
could be able to open it, until a success is achieved, or unless the
lock turns out to be actually impossible to pick.</p>
<p>Normally, any check that can rationally be performed more than once
in a row can be repeated by increasing the <strong>SL</strong> by 2
points. For example, suppose you’re retrying to break in an apartment;
you have to perform a check on a lockpick skill against a
<strong>SL</strong> of 21 (a normal check). On failure, your character
or another one in the group might try again, but this time the
<strong>SL</strong> will be 23.</p>
<p>The time required for an attempt is usually indicated in the
description of the target skill; if not, the Game Master decides how
long any attempt should take, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>It is possible to attempt the action again with its natural
<strong>SL</strong> letting a reasonable amount of time to pass. For
actions taking a few moments, it will be after a long rest (equivalent
of a good night of sleep). For actions requiring long preparation (i.e. 
studying the lore of a region), it might be a week or a month; if not
specified in the skill description, the Game Master will decide.</p>
<h2 id="contest">Contest</h2>
<p>Some actions are performed either in competition or against other
characters. When this happens, a <em>contest</em> (<strong>CNT</strong>)
must be performed. Both characters (or the Master in place of NPCs),
must perform the equivalent of a <em>simple check</em> on a <em>normal
difficulty</em>, trying to beat the opponent’s roll.</p>
<p>Some contest can be asymmetrical: for example, an attacker will roll
on some attack skill, while a defender will try and prevent the attacker
success using some defense skill. The skill and combat sections describe
some possible asymmetric skills, but players and masters (and other
expansions) might come up with new ones if the situation suggests
so.</p>
<p>The character having scored the highest result wins the contest, and
the <strong>SM</strong> is computed for the winner only (and so, it is
always positive).</p>
<p>Draws are normally allowed, and they might either mean that a new
situation has taken by both characters having achieved a success at the
same time, or nothing has changed as each character prevented the other
from acting.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that two characters struggle to reach for a
weapon during a brawl, with a contest on dexterity. If they roll a draw,
it means both of them reached for the weapon, and now the situation has
changed. A different contest may now take place: a contest on
<em>strength</em> to determine who can pull the hardest. This time, if
they have a draw, it means that none of them is able to snitch the
weapon from the other, and they can try again.</p>
<h3 id="non-draw-contests">Non-draw contests</h3>
<p>Contests that don’t allow draws are specifically indicated by the
rules as <em>Drawless Contests</em> (<strong>ndCNT</strong>). In this
cases, when a draw is scored, it is discarded as not performed, and
another contest takes place.</p>
<h2 id="rankings">Rankings</h2>
<p>Ranking rolls (<strong>RNK</strong>) are special contests between two
or more characters, ranking them in a order that doesn’t allow for
draws. Also, in <em>rankings</em> the <strong>SM</strong> is not
relevant.</p>
<p>For example, to establish the arrival order in a running relay, every
participant rolls a ranking on a skill used for running. The order of
arrival is decided once and for all, and draws are not allowed.</p>
<p>Draws are resolved by re-rolling on the same skill. The re-roll is
only relevant for the relative order of the characters in draw. For
example, suppose that, in said race, four character score a total of 26,
22, 22 and 20 respectively. Now, the second and third characters roll to
decide their relative position; the winner of the two will be the second
in ranking, and the looser will be the third, regardless of the score
they draw now.</p>
<h2 id="multi-contests">Multi-contests</h2>
<p>A multi-contest (<strong>mCNT</strong>) is a contest between two or
more parties, each comprising one or more characters.</p>
<p>In a multi-contest, each party performs a <em>ranking</em> on the
selected skill. Then, the best <em>check results</em> from each party
are compared against each other, and a point is assigned to the party
having the highest <em>check result</em> among the top scores in each of
them.</p>
<p>The contest continues comparing the second-best results, the
third-best results and so on, until all the parties have a score to
oppose to the others. Draws are discarded.</p>
<p>The party having scored the highest number of points is the winner.
If more than one party has totalized the same number of points, a
multi-draw happens; depending on the context (and on the rules), the
multi-draw might either lead to a new situation, or require the whole
multi-contest to be repeated.</p>
<p>The characters that have scored points for the winning parties are
called <strong>scorers</strong>; those who have lost their roll
(regardless of their party having won or not) are called
<strong>succumbers</strong>. The ones who couldn’t be matched with a
ranking from the other parties are <strong>excluded</strong>.</p>
<p>As there could be negative consequences for the losing parties, each
losing participant will receive the difference between their score and
the winner of their rank as a negative <em>success margin</em>,</p>
<p>Notice that a multi-contest between two parties comprising just one
character each is almost the same as a <em>direct contest</em>, with the
difference that, instead of assigning a positive <em>SM</em> to the
winner, a negative <em>SM</em> is assigned to the loser.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Three parties, composed of 3, 4 and 5
members respectively, try running up a hill before the others. They
perform a <em>multi-contest</em> on a skill or attribute used for
running. The rankings in each party result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Party A: 29-23-20</li>
<li>Party B: 26-25-22-19</li>
<li>Party C: 28-22-21-18-16</li>
</ul>
<p>The points are assigned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 29, B = 26, C = 28 - Point for A, <strong>SM</strong> of B = -3,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -1<br />
</li>
<li>A = 23, B = 25, C = 22 - Point for B, <strong>SM</strong> of A = -2,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -3</li>
<li>A = 20, B = 22, C = 21 - Point for B, <strong>SM</strong> of A = -2,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -1</li>
</ul>
<p>Group A has 1 point, while group B has 2: group B wins the
multi-contest.</p>
<p>The the fourth ranked in B, and the fourth and fifth in C are
<strong>excluded</strong> and will not contribute to winning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the most numerous group has an advantage in having more
chances to score high points than the others – everything else
equal.</p>
<p>The effect of the multi-contest in the adventure should reflect its
outcome. In this example, as team A had the highest score but ended up
losing the race, the two characters with the highest scores in parties A
and B might have fumbled on the hill, or grabbed each other in a brawl,
while the two characters having scored points for the winning party
would have reached the top, nearly followed by the losers, and at a
distance, by the ones excluded from the contest.</p>
<h2 id="ranking-generation-for-the-gm">Ranking generation for the
<strong>GM</strong></h2>
<p>In a multi-contest, each player rolls its own dice, and performs its
own computation, communicating the final result to the
<strong>GM</strong>; the players may even sort their scores before doing
that, helping out the GM in its task.</p>
<p>However, the GM is alone in rolling the dice for the characters they
control; repeating several 3d6 rolls and adding various modifiers that
can change during an action (i.e. because a GM controlled character gets
wounded) can be tiresome, and can slow down the pace of the game for the
players as well.</p>
<p>To prepare the multi-contest, the GM should: 1. Write the characters
he controls on a column of a notepad. 1. Besides each name, write the
modifiers for that characters, to be updated if the contest is repeated.
1. Unless each GM controlled character is special, the GM always assigns
the best outcome to the topmost character, so that it can read the
ranking results go top to bottom.</p>
<p>If the GM doesn’t have a dice-throwing application handy, which can
automate part of the process, it can use the following procedure to
generate multiple scores at once: 1. Roll 2d6 and write down the result.
2. Roll Nd6, where N is the count of character controlled by the
<em>GM</em>. 3. If more than one 6 is rolled, count them as 7, 8 etc. 4.
If more than one 1 is rolled, count them as 0, -1 etc. 5. Add each
single rolled result to the previous 2d6 roll.</p>
<p>For example, the GM controls 5 characters. 1. It rolls 2d6 for a
total of 7. 1. It now rolls 5d6, one per character; the results are 6,
6, 4, 1, 1. 1. The characters gets the following points, top to bottom:
7+7 = 14, 7+6 = 13, 7+4 = 11, 7+1 = 8 and 7+0 = 7. 1. Now the GM gets
the result from the players, and communicates the winning party, the
scoring characters and, if relevant, the negative <strong>SM</strong> of
the <strong>succumber</strong> characters.</p>
<h2 id="critical-results">Critical Results</h2>
<p><a href="#RB-automatic-results">Automatic results</a> in simple
checks are considered critical results, but a critical result can also
be achieved when the success margin of an action is extreme (in both
directions).</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, a <em>success margin</em> particularly
high is called <em>critical success</em> (<strong>CrS</strong>), and one
particularly low is called <em>critical failure</em>
(<strong>CrF</strong>).</p>
<p>Critical successes and failures will result in particularly good or
bad outcomes; when not specified by the rules or the skill description,
the Game Master will determine how the outcome exceeds a normal
result.</p>
<p>In a <em>contest</em> the <strong>SM</strong> can be only positive.
For this reason, a contest can’t determine <strong>critical
failures</strong>, only a <strong>critical success</strong> for the
winner.</p>
<p>Conversely, <strong>rankings</strong> have only negative
<strong>SM</strong>, so they can only result in <strong>critical
failures</strong></p>
<p>The following table describes which <strong>SM</strong> are
considered <strong>critical results</strong>, depending on the
complexity of the action. <em>Contests</em> are considered <em>normal
actions</em> on this regard, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h1 id="damage-and-injury">Damage and Injury</h1>
<p>A critical aspect of any RPG is the set of rules that determine how
characters sustain damage and receive injuries.</p>
<p>SIRPAS has a modular injury system, which can be fitted in any
setting and play styles.</p>
<p>It can be used to determine an overall result of a fight, or to
determine precisely which part of a human body, mechanical robot, flying
mount or AI virtual device has been damaged, and to what extent it has
been incapacitated.</p>
<p>It can be employed to keep the score of harmless intellectual
challenges, as well as devastating psychic attack on the mental sanity
of the characters.</p>
<h2 id="damage-points">Damage Points</h2>
<p>The <em>raw damage</em> a character receives is measured in
<em>damage points</em> (<strong>DP</strong>).</p>
<p>Damage can come in the way of characters in various forms, and from
various sources; hence, <strong>DP</strong> have also a
<em>quality</em>, which depends on which source is generating them.</p>
<p>A source could be physical harm, fatigue, heat, cold, mental stress
etc., as your module requires.</p>
<h2 id="effective-damage">Effective Damage</h2>
<p>Incoming <em>raw damage</em> is modified through the application of
<em>defenses</em>, that reduce it in various ways; they are mainly
divided in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Passive Defenses</em>: reducing the incoming
<strong>DP</strong>s of a flat amount (like physical armors), or
dividing the damage by a certain factor, i.e. 4/5 or 3/4 (like magic or
sci-fi shields), or eventually by an hybrid formula (as in the case of
specific resistances against some kind of damage).</li>
<li><em>Active Defenses</em>: the amount of reduced <strong>DP</strong>s
depends on the use of a certain character ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way different kind of damages impact on the characters is fully
considered by the way defenses are applied to reduce the incoming
<strong>DP</strong>s.</p>
<p>The count of <strong>DP</strong>s left after the defenses are applied
is called <em>effective damage</em> (<strong>ED</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="wounds">Wounds</h2>
<p>When sustaining a certain amount of damage, the character receive a
certain kind of wound, according with the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: right;"><strong>ED</strong></th>
<th>Wound</th>
<th style="text-align: right;"><strong>IP</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: right;">-</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Wounds are of the same type of the damage received. For example,
physical damage generate a physical wound; mental damage causes mental
wounds and so on.</p>
<p>The severity of the received wound and its type determine the amount
and type of <em>injury points</em> (<strong>IP</strong>) currently
sustained by a certain character; once the <strong>IP</strong>s are
above the maximum damage of a certain type a character can sustain, it
becomes <em>incapacitated</em>, and it may eventually die, if the wounds
are not treated.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-penalty">Wounds Penalty</h3>
<p>A character receives a penalty to any check of half the sum total of
<strong>IP</strong>s across all types (rounded down).</p>
<p>While the type of the wounds is relevant for the amount of damage
that can be sustained, that doesn’t matter for how well the character is
performing. You are not going to find a new theorem with an untreated
broken arm, and your fighting style will be less than effective if your
mind is in shambles.</p>
<h3 id="scratches">Scratches</h3>
<p>A character receiving an <em>effective damage</em> not less than 0,
but below the amount necessary to generate a light wound receives a
“scratch”.</p>
<p>Scratches are extremely light wounds that, by themselves, don’t
impact the character <strong>IP</strong> pool.</p>
<h3 id="scratches-to-wounds">Scratches to Wounds</h3>
<p>Once received a certain number of scratches, they are considered as
one light wound (<strong>Scratch To Wound</strong>, or
<strong>StW</strong>). By default, this value is 4, meaning that 4
scratches are considered a light wound, but this can be overridden by
modules depending on their setting.</p>
<h3 id="side-effect-of-non-scratches-optional">Side effect of
non-scratches (optional)</h3>
<p>When the <strong>ED</strong> is less than 0, that isn’t accounted as
a scratch. However, it may still generate negative side effects, for
example apply any form of physical or magical poisoning, inject a virus
in an AI or in a cyber brain and so on.</p>
<h2 id="direct-wounds">Direct Wounds</h2>
<p>In some situation, a character can receive a wound of a certain kind
directly, (not just as a consequence of receiving a certain amount of
<strong>damage points</strong>).</p>
<p>For instance, certain magic spells could cause a heavy wound directly
if the character fails an attempt to resist them. A overwhelmingly
powerful weapon, for example a starship laser directed against a human,
could have the same effect. Explicit actions performed on the character
when it is unable to defend itself could deal an arbitrary wound as the
attacker seems fit, etc.</p>
<p>Direct wounds will immediately apply the relative <strong>injury
points</strong> as if they were received through damage application.</p>
<h2 id="resistance-check">Resistance check</h2>
<p>In some situation, it’s possible to avert the received damage
partially or completely using a <strong>resistance check</strong>
(<strong>RC</strong>).</p>
<p>The resistance check is a <strong>simple check</strong> with a
difficulty modifier determined by seriousness of the damage that is
being averted.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a character is hit with a deadly poisonous dart.
To avert immediate death, they must perform a <strong>RC</strong>
against poison with <em>very hard</em> difficulty.</p>
<p>It’s not normally possible to avert non-lethal damage during combat
using a <strong>resistance check</strong>, unless specific advantages or
other module-specific rules provide this ability.</p>
<p>The attribute used for <strong>RC</strong>s is the most detailed one
that can be applied in the situation.</p>
<p>Suppose for example that a module defines hierarchy the
attributes:</p>
<pre><code>Body -&gt; Metabolism
Spirit -&gt; Willpower -&gt; Fear Resistance.</code></pre>
<p>In this situation, <strong>Metabolism</strong> would be used to
resist poison, while <strong>Fear Resistance</strong> would be used to
avert damages and negative effects caused by any <strong>fear</strong>
based attack.</p>
<p>In general, the attribute description gives a generic indication on
which type of damage it can avert; so the fact that
<strong>Metabolism</strong> could be used to resist poison damage (and
maybe some other negative effects) would be indicated in its
description.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Game Master can pick any attribute that would be
relevant, and ultimately, the most basic attributes if a specific one
can’t be found.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The base module defines <strong>resistance</strong> skills covering
all the damage sources it introduces.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="incapacitation">Incapacitation</h2>
<p>The amount of <strong>injury points</strong> that incapacitate a
character is defined by the modules, and can be tweaked by the Game
Master to better fit the mood of its campaign.</p>
<p>A realistic setting may set the limit for humans to 4 or 5 heavy
wounds, or equivalent amount of lighter wounds (that would be 16 or 20
points), but if characters are something different from humans
(e.g. vampires, werewolves, android etc.) they might have a greater
resistance to pain and/or damage.</p>
<p>Normally, a count of 20 <strong>IP</strong> would give a penalty of
-10 to any check, which may be severely limiting even for a powerful
character; however, the modules may provide means to reduce or ignore
the penalty under certain situations with advantages or special gear, as
enchanted armors, stimulant shots, magic spells, nanomachines etc.</p>
<h2 id="deadly-wounds-optional">Deadly Wounds (optional)</h2>
<p>When a character receives an amount of <em>ED</em> higher than the
higher limit for heavy wounds, it sustains a wound that is potentially
able to kill them immediately.</p>
<p>To avert an immediate death, the character must pass a <em>simple
check</em> on an attribute related with the type of damage received.</p>
<p>If the check is successful, the character receives a <em>heavy
wound</em> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the <em>resistance check</em> has a negative modifier
of half the received <strong>IP</strong>s, as any other action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="localized-wounds">Localized Wounds</h2>
<p>By default, wounds are generally applied in the generality of the
body, but some abilities allow to aim a certain specific part.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-to-limbs-or-periferical-devices">Wounds to limbs or
periferical devices</h3>
<p>When a wound is localized on a specific body part (an arm, a leg),
any action involving that body part receives the double amount of
penalty from that wound type (that is; the same amount of penalty as the
number of injury points that part has received).</p>
<p>For instance, a <em>heavy wound</em> localized on a leg will cause 4
<em>IP</em> as normal, resulting in a penalty of -2 points to any check,
but the penalty will be -4 or any skill involving jumping, running and
using specifically the legs.</p>
<p>This extends to non human and even virtual body parts as well: and AI
receiving a heavy wound on a virtual device will have a double penalty
if it tries to use that device to perform any action.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-to-the-head-or-control-unit-optional">Wounds to the head
or control unit (optional)</h3>
<p>When a wound affects the head (or other target part that is
particularly critical to control the behavior of the character), it
generates an additional <strong>injury point</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="healing">Healing</h2>
<p>The <strong>IP</strong> generated by wounds (and relative check
penalties) affect the characters until they are healed. Wounds are
healed one-by-one, unless a general healing procedure is applied (i.e. a
magic spell that restores the character health completely, a
backup-restore procedure on an AI etc.)</p>
<p>As a wound is cured through any mean (medicine, magic, natural
healing etc.), its <strong>IP</strong> cost and relative check penalty
are removed.</p>
<p>Light and serious wounds heal naturally after a reasonable amount of
time. Common sense can be used by the Game Master and the players to
determine the adequate time; for humans, a light wound may heal
completely in less than a week (generally, after a day of full rest and
basic treatment), while a serious wound would take about month (or a
week of full rest and basic treatment).</p>
<p>Heavy wounds require specific treatment to be cured.</p>
<h3 id="healing-scratches">Healing Scratches</h3>
<p>Scratches not turned into a light wound are removed after a
reasonable amount of time and minimal care adequate to the setting. For
example, in a fantasy setting, that may be spending a few minutes to
tend the wounds after a combat. In a cyberpunk setting, it may be
applying wound-reducing foams.</p>
<h3 id="day-rest-healing">Day-rest healing</h3>
<p>Unless differently specified by the modules a full day of rest and
basic tending will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heal all scratches not counted as light wounds;</li>
<li>If there character hasn’t got any scratches, heal 1 light
wound.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<p>Combat is an advanced form of contest. In a normal contest,
characters try to win one over another on specific skills, while in
combat, contests are finalized to deal damage or other negative effects
on an unwilling target.</p>
<p>SIRPAS offer three set of rules for resolving combat situations, with
increasing level of complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Simplified Combat</em>: It’s a simple way to resolve small
combat situations. It consists in a specialized form of <a
href="#multi-contest">multi-contest</a> applied to combat skills, which
takes into account the relative ranking in the contests to determine
winners, losers, and other possible outcomes.</li>
<li><em>Basic Combat</em>: It’s a sub-system dedicated specifically to
combat, using the combat skills with specific rules, and takes into
account positioning, tactical advantages and other combat-specific
elements.</li>
<li><em>Advanced Combat</em>: This is the full fledged combat system,
extending the <em>basic combat</em> and using special sub-skills called
<em>maneuvers</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can chose to stick with one combat system or mix and match them
the same adventure, without limitation, depending on how combat-centric
is your adventure, or how important is a specific combat in your
story.</p>
<h2 id="combat-skills">Combat skills</h2>
<p>Every form of combat is based on special attributes called
<strong>combat skills</strong>. They represent the proficiency of a
character in fighting.</p>
<p>Skills like (for example) <strong>archery</strong>,
<strong>gunslinging</strong>, <strong>kung-fu dragon style</strong>,
<strong>battle hacking</strong> or <strong>punching</strong>, or in
general, any natural, codified or semi-codified way to perform a fight
in the adventure setting are <strong>combat skills</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Combat skills</strong> work similarly to any other skill in
the system, with the addition of the following characteristic:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Range type</strong> (<strong>Rt</strong>): Can be
<strong>melee</strong>, <strong>ranged</strong> or
<strong>transcendental</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong>: Some skills can be used multiple times in
a combat turn. For example, a nimble skill having 3
<strong>actions</strong> would allow the character to attempt 3 attacks,
or move, switch weapon and attack, all in the same turn.</li>
<li><strong>Dominance</strong> (<strong>Dom</strong>): a value roughly
describing the effectiveness of the skill in a mixed combat, given
opponents of the same skill level.</li>
<li><strong>Style</strong>: A set of specific ways to use the combat
skill, called <strong>maneuvers</strong> causing special effects to take
place during the combat (used in the <em>advanced system</em>
only).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="generic-combat-skills">Generic combat skills</h3>
<p>Trying to attack any target against their will should always involve
a <strong>combat skill</strong>, even when not using a codified style of
fighting.</p>
<p>For example, a non-trained character may still just pick up a blunt
weapon and swing it, or pull a trigger of a loaded fire arm, or simply
try and punch someone, without a specific proficiency in a martial art
or any other experience about a specific way to fight.</p>
<p>The modules provide a set of “natural” <strong>generic combat
skills</strong>, that work as a default skill used when trying to attack
someone without any specific training. Of course, they are less
effective than specific combat skills, but they are also cheaper to
train.</p>
<p><strong>Generic combat skills</strong> always have a
<strong>dominance</strong> of 0, <strong>actions</strong> of 1 and they
don’t have an associated <strong>style</strong>, that is, they cannot be
used to execute any special <strong>maneuver</strong> in the advanced
combat system.</p>
<h3 id="skill-range">Skill Range</h3>
<p>Combat skills are divided into <em>melee</em>, <em>ranged</em> and
<em>transcendental</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Melee</em> skills work when the combatants are in <em>close
quarters</em>, and can physically harm each other without any
projection.</li>
<li><em>Ranged</em> skills use a weapon, a projectile or any mean to
physically project a harmful device or source of energy towards a
target. Skills of magical nature might be ranged if they magically
create a projectile, ray of energy or any physical mean to harm a
target.</li>
<li><em>Transcendental</em> skills require their user to know where a
target is in order to direct the attack, but they have no physical
range. The target could be on another planet, as long as the user has a
mean to see, feel or simply know <em>instantly</em> about it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="close-quarters">Close Quarters</h3>
<p>The <em>close quarter</em> distance it’s the distance at which a
melee attack can be proficiently employed.</p>
<p>It corresponds to the distance an average fighter can jump and
perform a melee attack in one swoop. This is normally 6 feet, but may be
different in settings where the characters have superpowers that allow
for faster movement (i.e. in an adventure about vampires), or different
sizes (i.e. in battles between giant robots).</p>
<h3 id="dominance">Dominance</h3>
<p>The <strong>dominance</strong> (<strong>Dom</strong>) of a combat
skill describes its effectiveness in a mixed combat, given opponents of
the same skill level.</p>
<p>For example, in a certain setting <strong>archery</strong> skill may
have <strong>Dom</strong> 3, while <strong>gunslinging</strong> has
<strong>Dom</strong> 6; this means that a gunslinger would way more
effective than a comparably competent archer on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Dominance is mostly used in the <em>advanced</em> combat system, but
is also used when mixing combat styles in the other systems. Whenever
different combat styles are employed, the <strong>dominance</strong>
value of each skill is added to every roll.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, suppose a brawl fight takes place in a tavern, and the
town guards, armed with their crossbows, turn in to stop the fight. As
far as the combat skills go, the guards are using
<strong>archery</strong>, while the brawlers are using
<strong>brawl</strong>. While guards are less experienced in their
<strong>archery</strong> than tavern goers are in their
<strong>brawl</strong>, <strong>archery</strong> has an innate
advantage: its <strong>Dom</strong> may be somewhere around 3, while
<strong>brawl</strong> <strong>Dom</strong> could be 0 or 1. To resolve
any fight, everyone will then add the value of the
<strong>dominance</strong> of they skill they want to (or can) use to
every roll they take.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="styles-and-maneuvers">Styles and maneuvers</h3>
<p>In the <em>advanced combat system</em>, <strong>Combat
skills</strong> are associated with a <em>style</em>, that is a
collection of actions that can be done using the skill (called
<strong>maneuvers</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>Maneuvers</strong> are not stand-alone skills, and they
cannot be target of advantages or perks.</p>
<p>The same combat style can also cover different type of weapons, with
some specific maneuvers limited to some weapons. For example, a combat
skill may be <strong>Firearms</strong>, covering any kind of modern
firearm, and its style may include maneuvers as <strong>rapid
reload</strong>, which applies only to pistols, and
<strong>sniping</strong>, which applies only to precision rifles.</p>
<p>Maneuvers have the following statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type: can be <strong>attack</strong>, <strong>defense</strong> or
<strong>action</strong>.</li>
<li>Modifier: positive or negative bonus to the combat skill for any
type of roll.</li>
<li>Prerequisite: minimum level of other attributes/skills required to
perform this maneuver.</li>
<li>Diminishing Return: modifier to the roll if using the same maneuver
more than once in a row.</li>
<li>Range: If the combat skill is ranged, the distance at which this
maneuver is effective.</li>
<li>Damage: How many <strong>DP</strong> the maneuver inflicts if
successful. Defenses and actions can have generate damage as well
(i.e. counter-attacks or actions causing indirect damage).</li>
<li>Status: a status alteration of the target if the maneuver is
successful (i.e. causing the target to be <em>stunned</em> for 2 turns,
and so on).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="BaM-m-simplified-combat">Simplified Combat</h2>
<p>This combat system can be used to resolve fights between small group
of opponents are facing each other with <em>compatible</em> fighting
skills and weaponry. For example, you can use this method when two small
bands are shooting at each other using using a <strong>firearm</strong>
or similar skill, or involved in a fist fight and using
<strong>brawl</strong>, or taking part in a little
<strong>swordfight</strong>_** skirmish.</p>
<p>It is also possible for parties to use different, but somewhat
compatible skills. For example, in a medieval tavern fight, guards may
interrupt a brawl using armed combat of some sort, or in a modern
setting, someone may pull out a firearm during a bar fight, of some
participant may not be confident in brawling and use a <strong>generic
combat skill</strong> and swing pieces of broken furniture around.</p>
<p>In this cases, each participant will add the
<strong>dominance</strong> value of the combat skill they’re using.</p>
<h3 id="fight-resolution">Fight Resolution</h3>
<p>The simplified combat is a modified repeated multi-contest without
draws.</p>
<p>The <strong>GM</strong> and/or the players decide how many rounds the
fight will last in advance, so that the best out of 1, 3, 5 (or more)
rounds wins the fight.</p>
<p>Each turn, every participant uses the skill it prefers to use in this
context (possibly, the best one). If the participants use different
skills, they add their respective <strong>dominance</strong> to their
throw.</p>
<p>On party draws (same number of points scored by each party), the
throws are repeated.</p>
<p>The effect of winning is determined by the circumstances. For
example, a tavern brawl is hardly lethal, and a “friendly” swordfight
(i.e. in order to subdue or dissuade an opponent) might simply end with
the surrender of the losing party. If that’s not the case, both winner
and losers may receive damage (with the losers generally receiving
more).</p>
<h2 id="injury-generation-in-simplified-combat-optional">Injury
Generation in Simplified Combat (optional)</h2>
<p>In simplified combat, a losing character receives a number of
<strong>DP</strong> equal to their (negative) success margin. For
example, if it loses with a <strong>SM</strong> of -6, it receives 6
<strong>DP</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reminder: each success margin is computed with respect to the throw
having the same ranking in the other team. Highest throw in team A is
compared with highest of team B, second highest of A with second highest
of B and so on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The character can then use any sensible mitigation (armor or skills,
if possible) to reduce the raw <strong>DP</strong>.</p>
<p>A <em>critical failure</em> means that the character receives a
<em>heavy wound</em> automatically. Notice that, if one party is larger
than the other, some of the characters in that party (the ones with the
lowest scores) will not be engaged directly in the fight; so, the
lowest-scoring characters will be mostly unharmed. However, they may
still score a <em>critical failure</em> and receive a wound because of
that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As all the other rules about damage, <strong>Injury Point</strong>
penalty applies to the simplified combat as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="fight-continuation">Fight Continuation</h3>
<p>If the characters so desire, they can continue fighting until the
losing party is ultimately defeated (all of its characters are disabled)
or decides to flee.</p>
<h2 id="basic-combat">Basic Combat</h2>
<p>Sirpas <em>basic combat</em> is a sub-system employed when two or
more parties are fighting each other.</p>
<h3 id="combat-turns">Combat Turns</h3>
<p>Combat is divided in turns. Normally, characters can perform just one
action per turn, but certain skills and advantages grant the ability to
perform more maneuvers.</p>
<p>The length of the turn depends on the settings: it might be one
second in a Wild West setting where gunslingers are fighting, ten
seconds when considering melee fights in medieval settings, one
nanosecond in fights between AIs, one minute in fights between giant
robots or starships and so on.</p>
<p>For most situations, you’ll want to consider the length of a combat
turn being 10 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="combat-order">Combat order</h3>
<p>Each turn, a ranking throw called <strong>combat order</strong> is
performed to determine the order in which every participant takes
action. The attribute used for the ranking is decided by the
<strong>GM</strong>, or it can be specified by the modules or adventure
settings.</p>
<p>Once the <strong>combat order</strong> is established, each character
takes action in turn, choosing what action they want to perform:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack</li>
<li>Wait for a better moment</li>
<li>Move</li>
<li>Switch Weapon</li>
<li>Use an item</li>
<li>Use a non-combat skill</li>
</ul>
<p>A character can use only a single combat skill during a turn, but
some combat skills provide multiple <em>actions</em>, which means they
can be used multiple times per turn to defend or attack.</p>
<p>A character can use the combat skill for defending against an attack
also if it’s not their turn; however, when their turn comes, they will
be able to attack only if they have some actions left unused.</p>
<p>A character might also decide not perform any action when their turn
comes; if so they can interrupt any other action performed later on by
others down the initiative ranking, or eventually use a defense to
respond to a later attack.</p>
<h3 id="instinctive-defense">Instinctive Defense</h3>
<p>In some situations, the defender is aware of the incoming attack
(i.e. has seen the attacker and is ready to receive the blow) but can’t
use any skill as a defense.</p>
<p>Typical reasons are: * The character already used all the actions at
their disposal in a combat turn and can’t react any more; * The defender
doesn’t have a proficiency in the skill used by the attacker, and is
just reacting instinctively. * The rules explicitly prohibit the use of
other defenses (i.e. when disengaging from the combat).</p>
<p>In those cases, provided the defender is at least aware of the
attacks, they can use an appropriate <strong>generic combat
skill</strong> as a defense. Some <strong>GCS</strong> are meant
specifically to be used as instinctive defense, and may have a better
base than more specific ones. For example, a module may have both
<strong>dodge</strong> and <strong>slash</strong> as
<strong>GCS</strong>, with <strong>dodge</strong> being a skill specific
for defense only, and with a better base value than
<strong>slash</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="mixing-different-skill-ranges">Mixing different skill
ranges</h3>
<p>In some cases, it is necessary to mix differently ranged skills as
attack and defenses. For example, an archer may be attacked in melee
range by someone swinging a sword; similarly, a martial artist may need
to dodge an arrow.</p>
<p>The situation is resolved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the opponents are in <em>close quarters</em>,
<strong>ranged</strong> skills have a -2 modifier when defending against
<strong>melee</strong> attacks.</p></li>
<li><p>When opponents are are not in <em>close quarters</em>,
<strong>melee</strong> skills have a -1 modifier when defending against
<strong>ranged</strong> attacks per every two times of the <em>close
quarter</em> distance.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a martial artist using defending against a sharp shooter
standing between 6 and 12 feet away would have a penalty of -1; at a
distance of 60 feet, the penalty would be -5 (60/6/2 = 5). This can seem
a lot, but ranged skills have penalties for long range shot and range
limits already: no one can hope to perform a valid melee defense against
a sniper hidden on the next hill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Transcendental</strong> skills cannot be use to defend
against <strong>melee</strong> or <strong>ranged</strong> skills, and
the other away around, <strong>melee</strong> and
<strong>ranged</strong> skills cannot be used to defend against a
<strong>transcendental</strong> attack.</p>
<h3 id="ranged-attacks-falloff">Ranged attacks falloff</h3>

<h3 id="attack-and-defense">Attack and Defense</h3>
<p>When an attack is declared, the target (or targets) can use a
defense, either by using a specific combat skill or a <em>generic
defense</em>.</p>
<p>The attacker and all the affected targets perform a Contest using
their chosen skill as a base.</p>
<p>The attacker rolls and adds the value of the skill, as for any
contest.</p>
<p>Determined the value for the attack roll, each defender performs its
defense, rolling on the chosen defense skill.</p>
<p>A draw means that neither the attack nor the defense have been
successful. A successful attack delivers a damage to the target. A
successful defense might have an effect that depends on the used skill
(it might also deliver a damage to the attacker).</p>
<h3 id="moving-during-combat">Moving during combat</h3>
<p>It is possible to move during combat at a speed that can be
reasonably covered in a combat turn. Modules can define the speed
depending on module-specific attributes.</p>
<p>Opponents targeting the character (either because they are nearby in
melee, or because they have aimed at them previously) can use an attack
against them to prevent them from moving, provided they still have
actions available in the combat round, and are in range of any part of
the path of their target. In that case, the moving character must
successfully defend using <strong>disengage</strong> as the only
possible defense.</p>
<p>The <strong>disengage</strong> defense is either a viable defense of
choice with -4 penalty, or a specific check/attribute defined by the
modules.</p>
<p>If it fails, other than receiving normal damage, it also stays
unmoved, and the action is nevertheless consumed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a character plans to move and there isn’t any urgency to do that,
it’s better to wait for any opponent that might target them to use up
all their attacks, so to be able to move freely.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="damage">Damage</h3>
<p>Damage is measured in <em>damage points</em> (<strong>DP</strong>),
and is accounted as the established by the <strong>injury</strong>
rule.</p>
<p>The damage delivered by a successful attack (or defense) is specified
in the skill description under the <em>base damage</em> voice; usually,
it’s computed adding the success margin of the contest to some attribute
based modifier.</p>
<p>The <em>dominance</em> of the skill, and eventually of the used
weapon, is added to the <em>base damage</em>; other modifiers
(i.e. temporary magic incantation) might further be applied.</p>
<p>The character receiving the damage computes its <em>damage
mitigation</em> (<strong>DM</strong>) by adding <em>passive
defenses</em> that can affect the damage source (i.e. armours), and
eventually <em>active defenses</em> they might use.</p>
<p>Finally, the target character receives a number of
<strong>ED</strong> = <strong>DP</strong> - <strong>DM</strong>. This
damage is accounted as specified by the <a
href="#injury-and-damage">injury and damage</a> rule.</p>
<h3 id="critical-rolls">Critical Rolls</h3>
<p>A critical success doubles the value of the <em>success margin</em>
when computing the <strong>DP</strong> (for the attacker) or the
<strong>DM</strong> (for the defender). When the damage roll doesn’t
involve the <strong>SM</strong>, the critical success adds automatically
4 points to the final result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notice that some defenses might generate a damage too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A critical failure indicates a failure even when the roll itself
would indicate a success. For example, suppose an attacker with
<strong>brawl</strong> 16 against a defender with
<strong>archery</strong> 5. If the attacker rolls 3, which is a critical
failure, the attack fails even if 16+3 would be above the archer’s
roll.</p>
<p>If both the attacker and defender roll a critical of the same type,
the critical part is discarded and only the roll result (with the
respective modifiers) is considered: critical failures or successes on
both sides elide each other.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-combat">Advanced Combat</h2>
<p>Advanced Combat is the most sophisticated combat sub-system; it
expands the basic combat system by adding a set of sub-skills for each
combat skill, called <strong>maneuvers</strong>. They represent special
actions a character can take while using the combat skill.</p>
<p>There are specific maneuvers to attack and defend in each style, and
each of them has different balances of difficulty of execution versus
potential damage, or different effects on the reset of the combat. Some
maneuvers provide modifiers to subsequent moves, while some other
generate damage also when defending.</p>
<h3 id="maneuver-types">Maneuver types</h3>
<p>Maneuvers are divided into <em>attacks</em>, <em>defenses</em> and
<em>actions</em>. Attacks and defenses represent a mores specific usages
of the base combat skill as per the <em>base combat</em> rules;
<em>actions</em> are other ways a combat skill can be employed.</p>
<h3 id="maneuver-modifier">Maneuver modifier</h3>
<p>Some maneuvers are more difficult than others; some rely on brute
force, others on finesse of execution. To reflect this, each maneuver
can offer different modifiers to the various combat skill rolls.</p>
<h3 id="diminishing-returns">Diminishing Returns</h3>
<p>Some maneuvers get a negative modifier if being used repeatedly
against the same target. For example, repeating using a brawl/punch has
diminishing returns: your opponent will read your move, and will be able
to better defend against the same attack. In those situations, you’ll
want to be less predictable, and use other maneuvers, or other styles
altogether.</p>
<p>This factor is called <strong>diminishing return</strong>
(<strong>DR</strong>) for a certain maneuver.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-theorycrafting-elements">APPENDIX: Theorycrafting
Elements</h1>
<p>In this appendix, you can find some technical elements about the
numbers behind the SIRPAS system.</p>
<p>This is also a place where we store our theory, and check our design
explicitly, to see how it works when the dice start rolling.</p>
<h2 id="chance-table">Chance Table</h2>
<p>This table gives you the probability to roll a certain number or to
beat a certain value with the sum of 3d6.</p>
<p>The “chance to match” column shows you how likely is to roll exactly
the value on the left column. The “Chance to Beat” is the probability to
roll a number <em>greater</em> than the one on the left. To get the
probability to roll <em>at least</em> the number on the left, add both
columns.</p>

<h2 id="contest-table">Contest Table</h2>
<p>This table shows how likely is to win, lose or achieve a draw on a
contest roll, given a certain difference in the base.</p>
<p>Suppose the base is the same for both characters; the difference of
the bases is zero. The probability to win or lose is the same, 45%, and
there is a 10% probability to roll a draw.</p>
<p>If a character rolls on a base 10, and the other has a base 13, the
difference is 3. The character with the base 10, reads its chances on
the -3 row, and the other uses the row number 3. In this case the
advantage character has 70% chance to win, 22% to lose and 8% to achieve
a draw; the position of the other character is reversed.</p>

<p>Consider: with a -3 modifier, you have only 1 chance over five to
win; be very cautious fighting characters with higher bases than
you.</p>
