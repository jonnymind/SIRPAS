<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>SIRPAS stands for “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”. It’s a
generic, modular and extensible table-top RPG system, that aims to be as
simple as needed and become as complex as you wish.</p>
<p>SIRPAS is organized in the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>rulebook</strong> (what you’re reading now): bare-bone
description of how the system works. There isn’t any list of skills,
attributes, or specific rendering of the rules in practice. At times
we’ll use some well known skill that may be found in any generic RPG
(e.g. <em>strength</em> or <em>climbing</em>) to make some example of
how the rules work, but nothing more.</li>
<li>The <strong>base system</strong>: a basic implementation of the
rules, which describes very generic attributes, skills, damage sources
and other concrete aspect of the system, that should be general enough
to be applied to most if not all the RPG settings you may come up
with.</li>
<li>Additional <strong>modules</strong>: Extension of the base system
(which may enrich it or change it if necessary), particularly adequate
to describe some specific world or setting for your adventures.</li>
</ul>
<p>All you need is the <strong>base system</strong>. The system will
often refer to the rules in this rulebook, so you will need to know
them, but you don’t need to know them <em>upfront</em>. The <strong>base
system</strong> will briefly explain the relevant rules when possible or
point at this rulebook when necessary. You may wish to read this book in
advance, skim over it, or just ignore it until you feel the need to read
some portions of it following the <strong>base system</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Experts</strong>: Feel free to skip the rest of this
introduction. The only thing an expert need to know about is that SIRPAS
is generic (setting-less), skill-based, using d6 only (and mostly 3d6)
with a fully modular system architecture. Detailed sub-system can be
used or ignored, depending on the mood of the night, while still having
your character set-up count. Also, all the systems are inter-playable:
you could bring a character from a Cthulu-esque campaign in a cyberpunk
settings, and the rules will work just fine.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-sirpas">What is SIRPAS?</h2>
<p>SIRPAS is a “SImple Role Playing Adventure System”.</p>
<p>So, we’re talking <em>adventures</em> here: a role playing session
that can spawn for a casual night with friends, or with the family, or
with strangers met at a gaming club. Systems thought for Role Playing
Games are (usually) complex enough for you to invest lots of time in
creating your characters, play through multiple sessions and use some
time off to sort your past games out to get fun out of them.</p>
<p>Some may say that’s actually part of the fun itself. If you like the
streamlined experience of Sirpas gameplay, you can play adventures
spawning multiple sessions, or multiple adventures with the same
characters, in the same world (this is often referred as
<em>campaign</em>).</p>
<p>But you don’t need to. The idea is having as little commitment as
necessary to get playing, and then, pour in as much commitment as you
want if you like it.</p>
<h2 id="a-system-for-everyone">A system for everyone</h2>
<p>Sirpas is for everyone: beginners, intermediate and veteran
players.</p>
<p>Who reads this manual and has never heard about role playing games
before will encounter many new terms that have a special meaning in RPG,
as <em>session</em>, <em>adventure</em>, <em>campaign</em>,
<em>world</em>, <em>setting</em>, <em>character</em>, etc. Also, they
might need on how to prepare, organize, manage, or even behave during a
session. This is important, but it is not covered in this manual. This
rulebook presents the game as succinctly as possible; all the concepts
commonly known in RPG can be easily found in the larger Internet.</p>
<p>However, to help the beginners getting on RPG with Sirpas, depending
on the media you’re reading the rulebook, we will:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>provide hyperlink to the description of the term.</li>
<li>highlighting terms with special meaning in RPG. A fast Internet
search for “RPG” and the highlighted word will bring you to the
description of the term.</li>
<li>Add a box named “For Beginners” near the relevant terms, that
experienced readers can skip.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="feel-of-the-system">Feel of the system</h2>
<p>Sirpas has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generic: rules are meant to be applicable in any settings you can
come up with. More on that later.</li>
<li>Modular: Sirpas has a lean set of rules called <strong>Base
System</strong>. The base system is generic enough to support any world
setting and playing style. On this base system, additional rules (called
<strong>modules</strong>) can be attached to better fit your game world.
Want a system to perform mind fights between Asimov inspired psionic
super-humans? We got you. Want a be a gunslinger involved in
western-styled show downs? That can be done too. A wizard casting magic
spells? No problem. An occultist summoning extra-dimensional entities?
That’s fine. The system is even flexible enough to merge multiple styles
of magic, melee combats, large scale fights and ranged missile firing in
the same session. Yes, you can bring a bow (or a knife) in a
gunfight.</li>
<li>Extensible: Other than designing your own additional modules, you
can also modify the base system to fit your need. For example, there
base system has two main attributes called <strong>Body</strong> and
<strong>Mind</strong>; if you want to play as an AI in a virtual world,
you may replace <strong>Body</strong> with <strong>MIPS</strong>
(millions of operation per second), and use <strong>Mind</strong> as an
expression of the quality of your O.S. and software. The rest of the
base system will still stand and be mostly useful for you to play
with.</li>
<li>Role-play oriented: the system emphasizes the build-up of the
character; both the composition of its skill set in the adventure world,
and the makeup of its personality, play a primary role in how the rules
unfold.</li>
<li>Simple as you want: the base system has differently detailed rules
to resolve game situations. For example, combat or any type of
confrontation between two opposing parties could be resolved with a
single throw of a few dices (Risk! style), or with the detail of a
Warhammer miniature replica battlefield.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the system is based on multiple rolls of a standard dice with 6
face; however, different modules support other kind of dices, if that’s
the vibe you want for your game.</p>
<h2 id="play-any-world">Play Any World</h2>
<p>Sirpas is a generic role playing system, that doesn’t presume
anything on the setting of your adventures. The system applies whatever
your players might want to play; as normal people struggling to survive
in a post-apocalyptic world, as wizards and knights in a high fantasy
setting, as cyborgs in a SF plot, or even as AIs in a virtual
reality.</p>
<h2 id="combatless-adventures">Combatless Adventures</h2>
<p>In most RPG settings, combat is a central part of the game action, if
not the absolute protagonist. This leads to RPG systems being usually
structured around the combat mechanics, and gaming sessions being mainly
occupied by detailing combat actions.</p>
<p>Sirpas works the other way around: the combat system is simply the
specialization of the general system. As such, is possible to run
adventures or entire campaign devoid of “combat”, and focusing either on
other kind of contest (as i.e. skill battles in virtual worlds), or in
other aspects of the role playing altogether.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, a police drama as a RPG setting. While
gunfights might play an important part in the campaign, the very nature
of a gunfight doesn’t translate into interesting RPG mechanics, while
more interesting actions as sword fights or martial art fights might not
fit the setting.</p>
<p>As such, Sirpas focuses on a more differentiated gameplay, which can
be as combat-intensive or combat-devoid as needed.</p>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<p>In SIRPAS, the statistics are all the numeric or quality values that
define a characters. They are divided in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attributes</strong>: important aspect of the character on
which many other mechanics depend. For example <em>body</em>
(<strong>B</strong>), <em>mind</em> (<strong>M</strong>),
<em>health</em> (<strong>H</strong>) and <em>will</em>
(<strong>W</strong>). <strong>Skills</strong> are special
<strong>attributes</strong> used to perform specific actions, as
<em>hacking</em>, <em>lock picking</em>, <em>running</em>,
<em>climbing</em> etc.</li>
<li><strong>Statuses</strong>: values that vary fluidly during an
adventure; for example, to keep track of the current health of a
character you can look at its <strong>injury points</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>/<strong>disadvantages</strong>:
Statistics affecting other skills, as example an expert modifier which
increase the chance of winning checks against a specific skill.</li>
<li><strong>Perks</strong>/<strong>drags</strong>: distinctive traits
setting the character apart from the background people in the setting.
Could be things a “famous” or “criminal”. They have an impact in the
adventure at large, and might also affect indirectly some checks,
providing bonuses and penalties at discretion of the game master.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="character-points">Character Points</h2>
<p>Character Points (<strong>CP</strong>) express the amount of
experience of your character, and with that, the amount of learning
(improvement of its statistics) that the character will perform during
the adventure, or in between adventures.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, statistics can be bought, and in some case sold, in
exchange with character points.</p>
<p>The amount of <strong>CP</strong> that must be spent to increase a
certain statistic vary depending on the nature of the statistic, and in
most cases, also depending on its current level. It is easier to
increase low scores, and as the statistic gets higher, it becomes harder
and harder to perfect it further.</p>
<p>Statistics are scored with their base and a specific amount of points
assigned to them. For example, the skill sprint is based on dexterity.
If the current value of dexterity is 10, and nothing has been invested
in sprint, then sprint will be 10 as well. To buy a point of sprint, the
character must invest the CP needed to bring it from 10 to 11. Now, if
at a later time the character increases its dexterity, the sprint skill
will increase as well, as the points previously spent on sprint
represent a bonus with respect to the dexterity base.</p>
<p>This means that it’s usually preferable to invest in the desired
skills in the beginning, and then increase the base at a later time. On
the other hands, later adventures typically provide a larger amount of
CP per session, so the decision whether to invest on single skills or on
more powerful bases, while important, is not as critical as it might
seem.</p>
<p>The following table describes how many CP must be spent in order to
increase a statistic. Skills have different costs, depending on the
complexity of learning a certain skill.</p>

<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes describe a character as succinctly as possible. They are
organized in a hierarchy. Higher level attributes are more
<em>generic</em>: they describe general aspects of your character. The
lower you descend in the hierarchy, the more detailed the attribute
become. At the bottom of the hierarchy we find <strong>skills</strong>,
that are attributes dedicated to performing specific actions.</p>
<p>Attributes and skills are normally expressed as a value between 3 and
18, which is the range of value that can be expressed by summing the
result of a 3d6 dice throw. A value of 3 represents the minimum skill
level, or characteristic, that a character could have to be still
considered minimally functional in the game world — a value below 3
would indicate a sub-normal characteristic. A value of 18 would
represent the apex for the game environment, and the values between 10
and 12 would be the most common across the reference population.</p>
<p>The scaling would be relative to the game setting. For example, if
playing a campaign where the characters are Greek or Norse gods, a value
of 3 on any statistic would probably express a level of proficiency far
superior to that of any human.</p>
<p>Notice that the scaling is not linear: it follows the probability
distribution of the 3d6 dice throw. For example, a character with
strength 12 is just marginally stronger than one with strength 11, but
one with strength 18 is in a totally different league than one with
strength 17. Similarly, characters with health 10 and 11 have a very
similar constitution, but one with health 3 will be much weaker than one
with health 4.</p>
<p>Different settings might introduce different ranges with other
scaling rules; for example in a vampire society, the Body attribute
(<strong>B</strong>) could be measured in a 0-100 range, where a B0 for
a vampire would be equivalent to a B18 for a human, and where the
difference between B0 and B1 and between B49 and B50 is the same.</p>
<h3 id="base-modifiers">Base Modifiers</h3>
<p>In some situation, instead of using a statistic as a direct base, the
system requires to use a base modifier (represented as
<strong>mX</strong> where <strong>X</strong> is the base attribute).</p>
<p>This happens when some statistics are baseless by their own nature,
but a base statistic influences them nevertheless.</p>
<p>For example, many combat styles are baseless, as you need to learn
them from scratch to be good at those, but characters with a higher
dexterity, or rather strength, are naturally better at it.</p>

<p>Suppose a skill has base declared as <strong>mD</strong>. This means
the base of that skill is not <strong>Dexterity</strong> directly, but
the modifier derived from the above table.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-descriptions">Attribute descriptions</h3>
<p>Attribute are described with: * Their short name (usually an acronym)
always in <strong>bold</strong>. * Their <em>base</em> formula, if any *
Their difficulty.</p>
<h3 id="training-attributes">Training attributes</h3>
<p>Higher level attributes form the <strong>base</strong> of the lower
level ones. This means that, by default, all the sub-attributes of a top
one will have its same value.</p>
<p>A player can increase the value of any attribute by
<strong>training</strong> it: using <strong>Character Points</strong> to
improve it. When it does so, all the lower level attributes grow with
their <strong>base</strong>. Of course, training on a base attribute is
more expensive than training on specific detail attributes.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that in a game world the attribute
<strong>Dexterity (D)</strong> is the base for <strong>Archery
(Arc)</strong>. A character that has never learned <strong>Arc</strong>,
but has a value of <strong>D</strong> 10, has a <em>default</em> value
of 10 in <strong>Arc</strong> as well. If the character trains on
<strong>Arc</strong>, it may get an extra point and have
<strong>D</strong>=10, <strong>Arc</strong>= <strong>D</strong>+1 =11.
If the character then trains on general <strong>D</strong> (which is
harder than specialize in <strong>Arc</strong>), so that its
<strong>D</strong>=11, its <strong>Arc</strong> grows to, as now
<strong>Arc</strong>= <strong>D</strong>+1 = 12.</p>
<p>The number of character point to be spent in each attribute or skill
to train it depends on how many other attributed are based on that, and
on the objective complexity of improving it.</p>
<h1 id="statuses-and-status-points">Statuses and status points</h1>
<p>Characters will sustain negative effects in pools called
<em>statuses</em>. Most statuses are binary, i.e. on or off. For
example, a character may be <em>asleep</em> or <em>awake</em>: it’s
awakeness status may be on/off.</p>
<p>Some statuses have numeric values, and the character will be
negatively affected if the number increases. For example, the number of
[injury points]( the higher the worse.</p>
<p>Finally, there are statuses that start at a certain maximum level,
and as the characters use their skills, they are used up. This statuses
are called <em>pools</em>, and various modules and sub-systems can
define different pools for specific usages. For example, a magic system
may define a <em>mana pool</em>, which determines how many spells a
character can cast.</p>
<h1 id="advantages-and-disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h1>
<p>Advantages special conditions that apply to the character in general
or to a specific attribute or set of attribute in particular, and that
have a direct effect on some game mechanics.</p>
<p>For example, some advantages may grant you the possibility to
automatically win a draw once a day. Others may give you extra dice to
throw and use in some situation. Others may give you one extra point to
all the skills having a certain base attribute, i.e. improve all the
skills based on <strong>Dexterity</strong>. Others may reduce the
difficulty level of the attempts on a certain skill by one level, so
that i.e. easy pickpocket targets become trivial, normal targets become
easy and so on.</p>
<p>Advantages can also be negative (disadvantages). A character might be
given disadvantages temporarily or permanently, because of what happened
during previous adventures, or as a background flavor. As disadvantages
have negative CP costs, a player can chose to get certain disadvantages
in order to gain <strong>CP</strong> to be spent elsewhere, in other
statistics.</p>
<p>While most advantages are simply either active or not, some can have
different levels. For example, an advantage called i.e. Survival
Instinct, which, say, reduce the difficulty level of all survival
checks, may have a level between 1 and 3, each granting a one extra
reduced difficulty level.</p>
<p>In that case, the description of the advantage indicates the initial
cost and the cost per additional level. The cost of a further level is
given by the base cost, plus the additional level cost times the current
level. For example, if the description indicates the cost in
<strong>CP</strong> being 5+2, it means that the first level costs 5,
the second 5+2<em>1 = 7, the third 5+2</em>2 = 9 and so on.</p>
<p>Some advantage could have a pre-requisite that must be fulfilled in
order to be acquired. For example, they could require having already
acquired another advantage, or having a certain statistic at a minimum
set score.</p>
<p>The GM may allow to get a certain number of advantages and/or
disadvantages to taken at character creation, or may allow to get some
of them later on if that’s fitting for the setting. For example, in a
cyberpunk setting, many advantages may be granted through body implants,
which may be be bought under certain conditions.</p>
<h1 id="perks-and-drags">Perks and Drags</h1>
<p>Perks and drags are generic advantages and disadvantages that don’t
impact the game system directly. They usually give more flavor in terms
of roleplaying, and better define a character in its settings.</p>
<p>Being famous, of noble origins, being able to play a certain
instrument, knowing a certain literature or scientific topic, being
rich, and the inverse of those are considered perks (or drags).</p>
<p>They can and usually will have an influence in how the adventure
plays, and some of them can have indirect and direct effect on the
rules.</p>
<p>For example, if a certain module has a <strong>Criminal Boss</strong>
perk, that may influence any attempt to <strong>intimidate</strong>
specific characters that know about the reputation of the character, and
have a reason to fear it.</p>
<h1 id="checks">Checks</h1>
<p>A check consists of throwing dices and verify if the result is
successful. Checks are the nuts and bolts of SIRPAS. Practically every
action that might succeed or fail requires performing a successful
check. There are different kind of checks that apply to different
situations, but in general, a check consists in beating some high point
score summing a 3d6 with the value of the statistics on which the check
is performed.</p>
<h2 id="simple-check">Simple check</h2>
<p>A <em>simple check</em> is a test for the character to be able to
perform a certain action, which requires a certain
<strong>skill</strong> to be employed. For example, to verify if the
character can land safely after jumping down from a height, it must pass
a <em>simple check</em> on a skill having that purpose (for example
<em>acrobatics</em>).</p>
<p>The skill descriptions indicate which actions are covered by each of
them. When a character wants to perform an action not covered by a
specific skill, one of its generic attributes are used instead; the Game
Master decide which is the most adequate one. For example, if a
character is trying to extract a sword stuck on a wooden beam, which is
a situation not covered by any skill in the base manual, the Game Master
might ask to pass a <em>simple check</em> on its <em>strength</em>.</p>
<p>To <em>perform</em> a <strong>simple check</strong> means to throw
three dice (or a different number, where the rules specify it) and sum
the result of the rolled dice to the value of the employed skill or
attribute. The rules might specify other modifiers to be applied to
specific checks; for example being injured applies a penalty to any
check.</p>
<p>The sole result of the dice rolls is called <strong>natural
result</strong>, while the grand total of the <strong>natural
result</strong>, skill or attribute value and modifiers is called
<em>check result</em> (<strong>CR</strong>). To win (or <em>pass</em>) a
<strong>simple check</strong>, the <strong>check result</strong> must be
above a score called <em>success level</em> (<strong>SL</strong>) that
depends on the difficulty of the action, according with the following
table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Difficuylty</th>
<th style="text-align: right;">Success Level</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Trivial</td>

<td style="text-align: right;">27</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Very Hard</td>
<td style="text-align: right;">29</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Skill descriptions will reference this table to specify which kind
off attempt are to considered, easy, normal, hard and so on. When the
skill description doesn’t specify it, the Game Master can assign a
difficulty modifier depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Some skills may be performed only against a <strong>normal</strong>
success level, but assign an additional bonus or penalty depending on
the situation. For example, trying to perform an acrobatic action while
jumping from high may inflict a penalty that increases in proportion to
the height of the jump.</p>
<h3 id="success-margin">Success Margin</h3>
<p>The difference between the <strong>check result</strong> and the
<strong>success level</strong> is called <strong>Success Margin</strong>
(<strong>SM</strong>). The <strong>SM</strong> is 0 or above on success,
and less than 0 on failure.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-results">Automatic Results</h3>
<p>In a <strong>simple check</strong>, When a <em>natural 18</em> is
scored, and if the action is of <em>normal</em> difficulty or easier,
the <em>simple check</em> is automatically passed, regardless the
<em>check result</em> being actually above the required
<strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p>When a <em>natural 3</em> is scored, and if the action is of
<em>normal</em> difficulty or harder, the <em>simple check</em>
automatically fails, regardless the <em>check result</em> being actually
below the required <strong>SL</strong> or not.</p>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong> <em>easy</em> actions have an
<em>automatic success</em> with a <em>natural 17</em> or better and
<em>very easy</em> actions with a <em>natural 16</em> or better.
<em>Hard</em> actions fail automatically with a <em>natural 4</em> or
worse, and <em>very hard</em> actions with a <em>natural 5</em> or
worse.</p>
<p>An <strong>automatic result</strong> is considered also a
<strong>critical success</strong> or <strong>critical
failure</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="repeated-attempts">Repeated Attempts</h2>
<p>In some situation, it is possible to repeat a failed attempt soon
after the first try, either by the same character or by another one in
the same group.</p>
<p>For example, picking a lock (when no one is around and there aren’t
time constraints) can be repeated indefinitely by every member that
could be able to open it, until a success is achieved, or unless the
lock turns out to be actually impossible to pick.</p>
<p>Normally, any check that can rationally be performed more than once
in a row can be repeated by increasing the <strong>SL</strong> by 2
points. For example, suppose you’re retrying to break in an apartment;
you have to perform a check on a lockpick skill against a
<strong>SL</strong> of 21 (a normal check). On failure, your character
or another one in the group might try again, but this time the
<strong>SL</strong> will be 23.</p>
<p>The time required for an attempt is usually indicated in the
description of the target skill; if not, the Game Master decides how
long any attempt should take, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>It is possible to attempt the action again with its natural
<strong>SL</strong> letting a reasonable amount of time to pass. For
actions taking a few moments, it will be after a long rest (equivalent
of a good night of sleep). For actions requiring long preparation (i.e. 
studying the lore of a region), it might be a week or a month; if not
specified in the skill description, the Game Master will decide.</p>
<h2 id="contest">Contest</h2>
<p>Some actions are performed either in competition or against other
characters. When this happens, a <em>contest</em> (<strong>CNT</strong>)
must be performed. Both characters (or the Master in place of NPCs),
must perform the equivalent of a <em>simple check</em> on a <em>normal
difficulty</em>, trying to beat the opponent’s roll.</p>
<p>Some contest can be asymmetrical: for example, an attacker will roll
on some attack skill, while a defender will try and prevent the attacker
success using some defense skill. The skill and combat sections describe
some possible asymmetric skills, but players and masters (and other
expansions) might come up with new ones if the situation suggests
so.</p>
<p>The character having scored the highest result wins the contest, and
the <strong>SM</strong> is computed for the winner only (and so, it is
always positive).</p>
<p>Draws are normally allowed, and they might either mean that a new
situation has taken by both characters having achieved a success at the
same time, or nothing has changed as each character prevented the other
from acting.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that two characters struggle to reach for a
weapon during a brawl, with a contest on dexterity. If they roll a draw,
it means both of them reached for the weapon, and now the situation has
changed. A different contest may now take place: a contest on
<em>strength</em> to determine who can pull the hardest. This time, if
they have a draw, it means that none of them is able to snitch the
weapon from the other, and they can try again.</p>
<h3 id="non-draw-contests">Non-draw contests</h3>
<p>Contests that don’t allow draws are specifically indicated by the
rules as <em>Drawless Contests</em> (<strong>ndCNT</strong>). In this
cases, when a draw is scored, it is discarded as not performed, and
another contest takes place.</p>
<h2 id="rankings">Rankings</h2>
<p>Ranking rolls (<strong>RNK</strong>) are special contests between two
or more characters, ranking them in a order that doesn’t allow for
draws. Also, in <em>rankings</em> the <strong>SM</strong> is not
relevant.</p>
<p>For example, to establish the arrival order in a running relay, every
participant rolls a ranking on a skill used for running. The order of
arrival is decided once and for all, and draws are not allowed.</p>
<p>Draws are resolved by re-rolling on the same skill. The re-roll is
only relevant for the relative order of the characters in draw. For
example, suppose that, in said race, four character score a total of 26,
22, 22 and 20 respectively. Now, the second and third characters roll to
decide their relative position; the winner of the two will be the second
in ranking, and the looser will be the third, regardless of the score
they draw now.</p>
<h2 id="multi-contests">Multi-contests</h2>
<p>A multi-contest (<strong>mCNT</strong>) is a contest between two or
more parties, each comprising one or more characters.</p>
<p>In a multi-contest, each party performs a <em>ranking</em> on the
selected skill. Then, the best <em>check results</em> from each party
are compared against each other, and a point is assigned to the party
having the highest <em>check result</em> among the top scores in each of
them.</p>
<p>The contest continues comparing the second-best results, the
third-best results and so on, until all the parties have a score to
oppose to the others. Draws are discarded.</p>
<p>The party having scored the highest number of points is the winner.
If more than one party has totalized the same number of points, a
multi-draw happens; depending on the context (and on the rules), the
multi-draw might either lead to a new situation, or require the whole
multi-contest to be repeated.</p>
<p>The characters that have scored points for the winning parties are
called <strong>scorers</strong>; those who have lost their roll
(regardless of their party having won or not) are called
<strong>succumbers</strong>. The ones who couldn’t be matched with a
ranking from the other parties are <strong>excluded</strong>.</p>
<p>As there could be negative consequences for the losing parties, each
losing participant will receive the difference between their score and
the winner of their rank as a negative <em>success margin</em>,</p>
<p>Notice that a multi-contest between two parties comprising just one
character each is almost the same as a <em>direct contest</em>, with the
difference that, instead of assigning a positive <em>SM</em> to the
winner, a negative <em>SM</em> is assigned to the loser.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Three parties, composed of 3, 4 and 5
members respectively, try running up a hill before the others. They
perform a <em>multi-contest</em> on a skill or attribute used for
running. The rankings in each party result in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Party A: 29-23-20</li>
<li>Party B: 26-25-22-19</li>
<li>Party C: 28-22-21-18-16</li>
</ul>
<p>The points are assigned as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A = 29, B = 26, C = 28 - Point for A, <strong>SM</strong> of B = -3,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -1<br />
</li>
<li>A = 23, B = 25, C = 22 - Point for B, <strong>SM</strong> of A = -2,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -3</li>
<li>A = 20, B = 22, C = 21 - Point for B, <strong>SM</strong> of A = -2,
<strong>SM</strong> of C = -1</li>
</ul>
<p>Group A has 1 point, while group B has 2: group B wins the
multi-contest.</p>
<p>The the fourth ranked in B, and the fourth and fifth in C are
<strong>excluded</strong> and will not contribute to winning.
Nevertheless, the most numerous group has an advantage in having more
chances to score high points than the others – everything else
equal.</p>
<p>The effect of the multi-contest in the adventure should reflect its
outcome. In this example, as team A had the highest score but ended up
losing the race, the two characters with the highest scores in parties A
and B might have fumbled on the hill, or grabbed each other in a brawl,
while the two characters having scored points for the winning party
would have reached the top, nearly followed by the losers, and at a
distance, by the ones excluded from the contest.</p>
<h2 id="ranking-generation-for-the-gm">Ranking generation for the
<strong>GM</strong></h2>
<p>In a multi-contest, each player rolls its own dice, and performs its
own computation, communicating the final result to the
<strong>GM</strong>; the players may even sort their scores before doing
that, helping out the GM in its task.</p>
<p>However, the GM is alone in rolling the dice for the characters they
control; repeating several 3d6 rolls and adding various modifiers that
can change during an action (i.e. because a GM controlled character gets
wounded) can be tiresome, and can slow down the pace of the game for the
players as well.</p>
<p>To prepare the multi-contest, the GM should: 1. Write the characters
he controls on a column of a notepad. 1. Besides each name, write the
modifiers for that characters, to be updated if the contest is repeated.
1. Unless each GM controlled character is special, the GM always assigns
the best outcome to the topmost character, so that it can read the
ranking results going top to bottom.</p>
<p>If the GM doesn’t have a dice-throwing application handy, which can
automate part of the process, it can use the following procedure to
generate multiple scores at once: 1. Roll 2d6 and write down the result.
1. Roll Nd6, where N is the count of character controlled by the
<em>GM</em>. 1. If more than one 6 is rolled, count them as 7, 8 etc. 1.
If more than one 1 is rolled, count them as 0, -1 etc. 1. Add each
single rolled result to the previous 2d6 roll.</p>
<p>For example, the GM controls 5 characters. 1. It rolls 2d6 for a
total of 7. 1. It now rolls 5d6, one per character; the results are 6,
6, 4, 1, 1. 1. The characters gets the following points, top to bottom:
7+7 = 14, 7+6 = 13, 7+4 = 11, 7+1 = 8 and 7+0 = 7. 1. Now the GM gets
the result from the players, and communicates the winning party, 1. the
scoring characters and, if relevant, the negative <strong>SM</strong> of
the <strong>succumber</strong> characters.</p>
<h2 id="critical-results">Critical Results</h2>
<p><a href="#RB-automatic-results">Automatic results</a> in simple
checks are considered critical results, but a critical result can also
be achieved when the success margin of an action is extreme (in both
directions).</p>
<p>Unless specified otherwise, a <em>success margin</em> particularly
high is called <em>critical success</em> (<strong>CrS</strong>), and one
particularly low is called <em>critical failure</em>
(<strong>CrF</strong>).</p>
<p>Critical successes and failures will result in particularly good or
bad outcomes; when not specified by the rules or the skill description,
the Game Master will determine how the outcome exceeds a normal
result.</p>
<p>In a <em>contest</em> a <em>critical success</em> can be scored only
by the winning party (as the <strong>SM</strong> can be only positive,
and is assigned to the winner); hence, a contest can’t determine
<strong>critical failures</strong>.</p>
<p>Conversely, <strong>rankings</strong> have only negative
<strong>SM</strong>, so they cannot result in <strong>critical
successes</strong>.</p>
<p>The following table describes which <strong>SM</strong> are
considered <strong>critical results</strong>, depending on the
complexity of the action. <em>Contests</em> are considered <em>normal
actions</em> on this regard, unless specified otherwise.</p>

<h1 id="damage-and-injury">Damage and Injury</h1>
<p>A critical aspect of any RPG is the set of rules that determine how
characters sustain damage and receive injuries.</p>
<p>SIRPAS has a modular injury system, which can be fitted in any
setting and play styles.</p>
<p>It can be used to determine an overall status of a fight, or to
determine precisely which part of a human body, mechanical robot, flying
mount or AI virtual device has been damaged, and to what extent it has
been incapacitated.</p>
<p>It can be employed to keep the score of harmless intellectual
challenges, as well as devastating psychic attack on the mental sanity
of the characters.</p>
<h2 id="damage-points">Damage Points</h2>
<p>The <em>raw damage</em> a character receives is measured in
<em>damage points</em> (<strong>DP</strong>).</p>
<p>Damage can come in the way of characters in various forms, and from
various sources; hence, <strong>DP</strong> have also a
<em>quality</em>, which depends on which source is generating them.</p>
<p>A source could be physical harm, fatigue, heat, cold, mental stress
etc., as your module requires.</p>
<h2 id="effective-damage">Effective Damage</h2>
<p>Incoming <em>raw damage</em> is modified through the application of
<em>defenses</em>, that reduce it in various ways; they are mainly
divided in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Passive Defenses</em>: reducing the incoming
<strong>DP</strong>s of a flat amount (like physical armors), or
dividing the damage by a certain factor, i.e. 4/5 or 3/4 (like magic or
sci-fi shields), or eventually by an hybrid formula (as in the case of
specific resistances against some kind of damage).</li>
<li><em>Active Defenses</em>: the amount of reduced <strong>DP</strong>s
depends on the use of a certain character ability.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way different kind of damages impact on the characters is fully
considered by the way defenses are applied to reduce the incoming
<strong>DP</strong>s.</p>
<p>The count of <strong>DP</strong>s left after the defenses are applied
is called <em>effective damage</em> (<strong>ED</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="effective-damage-and-wounds">Effective Damage and Wounds</h2>
<p>When sustaining a certain amount of damage, the character receive a
certain kind of wound, according with the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: right;"><strong>ED</strong></th>
<th>Wound</th>
<th style="text-align: right;"><strong>IP</strong></th>

<td style="text-align: right;">-</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Wounds are of the same type of the damage received. For example,
physical damage generate a physical wound; mental damage causes mental
wounds and so on.</p>
<p>The severity of the received wound and its type determine the amount
and type of <em>injury points</em> (<strong>IP</strong>) currently
sustained by a certain character; once the <strong>IP</strong>s are
above the maximum damage of a certain type a character can sustain, it
becomes <em>incapacitated</em>, and it may eventually die, if the wounds
are not treated.</p>
<p>The number of <em>IP</em> that can be received before being
incapacitated is determined by the <strong>resistance</strong>
(<strong>Res</strong>) towards that damage source, which is an
attributed defined by each module.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-penalty">Wounds Penalty</h3>
<p>A character receives a penalty to any check of half the sum total of
<strong>IP</strong>s across all types (rounded down).</p>
<p>While the type of the wounds its relevant for the amount of damage
that can be sustained, that doesn’t matter for how well the character is
performing. You are not going to find a new theorem with a broken arm,
and your fighting style will be less than effective if your mind is in
shambles.</p>
<h2 id="scratches">Scratches</h2>
<p>A character receiving an <em>effective damage</em> greater than 0,
but below the amount necessary to generate a wound receives a
“scratch”.</p>
<p>Scratches are extremely light wounds that, by themselves, don’t
impact the character <strong>IP</strong> pool.</p>
<p>However, once received a certain number of scratches, they are
considered as one light wound. The number is determined by the
<strong>scratch resistance</strong> (<strong>SRes</strong>) to that
damage type, which is defined by each module.</p>
<h3 id="non-scratches-optional">Non-scratches (optional)</h3>
<p>When the damage received is mitigated to the point to be
insignificant, it doesn’t generate a scratch.</p>
<p>Unless the module specifies differently, when the <strong>ED</strong>
is -3 or less, that isn’t accounted as a scratch. However, it may still
generate negative effects, for example apply any form of physical or
magical poisoning, inject a virus in an AI or in a cyber brain and so
on.</p>
<h2 id="deadly-wounds-optional">Deadly Wounds (optional)</h2>
<p>When a character receives more than 9 <em>ED</em> points, it sustains
a wound that is potentially able to kill them immediately.</p>
<p>To avert an immediate death, the character must pass a <em>simple
check</em> on the <strong>resistance</strong> (<strong>Res</strong>) to
the specific damage source, which is determined by each module.</p>
<p>When character can’t use any specific resistance skill, the check is
performed on <strong>body</strong>, if the damage is physical, or
<strong>mind</strong>, if it’s mental.</p>
<p>If the check is successful, the character receives a <em>heavy
wound</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember that the <em>resistance check</em> has a negative modifier
of half the received <strong>IP</strong>s, as any other action.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="direct-wounds">Direct Wounds</h2>
<p>In some situation, a character can receive a wound of a certain kind
directly, and not as a consequence of a damage source dealing damage
points. For instance, certain magic spells could cause a heavy wound
directly, if the character fails an attempt to resist them. A
overwhelmingly powerful weapon, for example a starship laser directed
against a human, could have the same effect. Explicit actions performed
on the character when it is unable to defend itself (i.e. forms of
physical or mental torture) could deal an arbitrary wound as the
attacker seems fit, etc.</p>
<p>Direct wounds will immediately apply the relative <strong>injury
points</strong> as if they were received through damage application.</p>
<h2 id="localized-wounds">Localized Wounds</h2>
<p>By default, wounds are generally directed in the generic direction of
the body, but some abilities allow to aim a certain specific part of the
body.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-to-limbs-or-periferical-devices">Wounds to limbs or
periferical devices</h3>
<p>When a wound is localized on a specific body part (an arm, a leg),
any action involving that body part receives the double amount of
penalty from that wound type. For instance, a <em>heavy wound</em>
localized on a leg will generate 2 <em>IP</em> as normal, generating a
penalty of 2 points to any check, but the penalty will be -4 or any
skill involving jumping, running and using specifically the legs.</p>
<p>This extends to non human and even virtual body parts as well: and AI
receiving a heavy wound on a virtual device will have a double penalty
if it tries to use that device to perform any action.</p>
<h3 id="wounds-to-the-head-or-control-unit">Wounds to the head or
control unit</h3>
<p>When a wound affects the head (or other target part that is
particularly critical to control the behavior of the target), it
generates an additional <strong>injury point</strong>. <em>Light
wounds</em> generate 1 <em>IP</em>, while <em>medium</em> and <em>heavy
wounds</em> generate 2 and 3 <strong>IP</strong> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="curing-wounds">Curing wounds</h3>
<p>As a wound is cured through any mean (medicine, magic, natural
healing etc.), its <strong>IP</strong> cost is removed.</p>
<p>Scratches not turned into a light wound are removed after a
reasonable amount of time and minimal care adequate to the setting. For
example, in a fantasy setting, that may be spending a few minutes to
tend the wounds after a combat. In a cyberpunk setting, it may be
applying wound-reducing foams.</p>
<p><strong>Optional</strong>: in any setting, the equivalent of a day of
rest should clear any scratch.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-theorycrafting-elements">APPENDIX: Theorycrafting
